Attempting to replace a broken lamp on your own creates the risk of personal injury due to broken glass or dispersed mercury. Warning Caution Operating Precautions 10 Operating Precautions G Never touch the glass of the lamp with your fingers. Doing so can damage the lamp and shorten its life. G The light source lamp is a consumable item. The average life of a lamp is approximately 2000 hours. After 2000 hours, a message appears to alert you to the need of lamp replacement. However, note that the characteristics of a particular lamp or lamp operating conditions can cause the lamp to start to go dim or even fail before the message appears. G Lamps are guaranteed for 90 days from the date of purchase or for 500 hours operation, whichever comes first. G A mercury lamp with high internal pressure is used as the light source. A lamp that is weakened by impact, damage, or expiration of its lamp life may explode or fail to light if exposed to loud noise. Note that the performance of the lamp differs greatly from lamp to lamp, and due to conditions under which a lamp is used. G The replacement message appears and the LAMP indicator flashes red after the lamp life is reached. When this happens, replace the lamp using the instructions provided in this User’s Guide. G If the lamp continues to be used after its lamp life is reached, after 100 hours the projector will enter a cool down state and then go into standby. The projector will not turn on again until you replace the lamp. G When the lamp life is reached, the message “It is time to replace the lamp. Use the procedure in the User’s Guide to replace the lamp as soon as possible.” appears on the display for about 10 seconds, and the LAMP indicator starts to flash red in one-second intervals. Replace the lamp as soon as possible after the message appears or the LAMP indicator flashes. G Replace the lamp with a special YL-30 replacement lamp, which should be available from your original dealer. G Turn off the projector. After the POWER/STANDBY indicator changes to steady (not flashing) amber, unplug the projector from the power outlet. Next, wait for at least 60 minutes before removing the lamp. Note that the lamp cartridge becomes very hot during normal use and during standby. Handling it when hot creates the risk of burn injury. G The lamp contains mercury. Dispose of old lamps in accordance with the rules and regulations of your local jurisdiction. G When replacing the lamp, use the special screwdriver that comes with the YL-30 replacement lamp.

Front Back Getting Ready 28 Getting Ready This section explains how to set up the projector to get it ready for use, and how to connect it to an input source (computer or video device). It also includes information about how to turn on the projector, how to select the display language the first time you turn it on, and precautions you need to keep in mind concerning the power supply. This projector is designed for tabletop use only. Place the projector onto a table, desk, or stand that is level and firm, making sure you allow enough room around it. z The following illustrations show how the projector should be oriented for optimum projection relative to the screen. z You can place the projector on a surface that is angled up to 30 degrees up or down during use.Angling the projector more than 30 degrees up or down can cause rupture or premature aging of the projector's lamp,or malfunction of the projector. z The above setup enables proper projection without any image correction. If the projector is at an angle to the screen, a phenomenon called “keystoning” will occur, which causes the sides, and/or the top and bottom of the image to be different lengths.

Projection Operations 43 Projection Operations This section explains operations that are related to projection of an image. This section explains the basic steps for projecting an image. Basic Flow Projecting onto a Screen Preparing the Projector Starting Projection Set up the projector and point it at the screen.  “Setting Up the Projector” (page 28) Connect the computer or video device to the projector ( 34 to 37). Turn on the projector and the connected computer or video device. Press the [ ] (power) key to turn on the projector.  “Turning On the Projector” (page 38) Perform fine adjustment of the projection position and angle.  “Adjusting the Projector Elevation Angle” (page 32) Select the input source.  “Manually Selecting the Input Source” (page 45) Adjust the projected image size and focus the image.  “Zoom and Focus” (page 47) Start projection (presentation, video, etc.) • Perform the required operation on the input source computer or video equipment. • Use the projector’s various functions to adjust the projected image as required. Projection Operations 44 Auto Input Source Selection When you turn on the projector, it checks the status of each input source (whether or not the input source is sending a signal) in the sequence shown below. It automatically selects the first input source it finds that is sending an input signal, and projects the applicable image. If the RGB input terminal is connected to a computer and the S-VIDEO input terminal is connected to a video deck and signals are being supplied by both, for example, the projector automatically selects RGB input when it is turned on. The currently selected input source name is shown in the upper right corner of the projection screen. z If the projector does not find any input signal, the message “No signal input” appears in place of the input source name. z Whether the displayed input source name shows [RGB] or [Component] depends on the current “Input Settings J RGB Input” (page 85) setting that is configured on the projector’s setup menu. For information about configuring setup menu settings, see “Using the Setup Menu” on page 61. For information about component video, see “Connecting to a Component Video Output Device” on page 37. z Note that the projector does not select the input source automatically when “Off” is selected for the “Option Settings J Auto Input Detect” (page 89) setting on the setup menu. If the input source name shows this: It means this input is selected: RGB RGB Component Component video RGB terminal input VIDEO terminal input S-VIDEO terminal input (RGB/Component) (VIDEO) (S-VIDEO) Input source name RG B 45 Projection Operations Manually Selecting the Input Source The procedure you should use to select the input source depends on whether you are using projector keys or remote controller keys. To select the input source using projector keys On the projector, press the [INPUT] key to cycle through input sources in the sequence shown below. [Projector] [Remote Controller] [INPUT] key [S-VIDEO] key [VIDEO] key [RGB/COMPONENT] key (RGB/Component) (VIDEO) (S-VIDEO) Projection Operations 46 To select the input source using remote controller keys On the remote controller, press the [RGB/COMPONENT], [VIDEO], or [S-VIDEO] key to select the input source you want. z The currently selected input source name is shown in the upper right corner of the projection screen. z If the currently selected input source is not sending an input signal, the message “No signal input” appears in place of the input source name. z Whether the displayed input source name shows [RGB] or [Component] depends on the current “Input Settings J RGB Input” (page 85) setting that is configured on the projector’s setup menu. For information about configuring setup menu settings, see “Using the Setup Menu” on page 61. For information about component video, see “Connecting to a Component Video Output Device” on page 37. If the input source name shows this: It means this input is selected: RGB RGB Component Component video 47 Projection Operations Zoom and Focus Use the zoom ring to adjust the image size, and the focus ring to focus the image. To adjust the image size To focus the image It is best to have a still image on the screen when you focus the image. z Performing zoom after focusing can cause the image to go out of focus. If this happens, focus again. Smaller Larger Zoom ring Focus ring Projection Operations 48 Auto Adjustment of an RGB Image When the input source is RGB (computer), the projector automatically adjusts vertical and horizontal positioning, frequency, and phase whenever it detects an RGB signal (following input source selection, power up, etc.) You can also execute an automatic adjustment operation by pressing the [AUTO] key. z You can turn off auto adjustment (page 90) when you want to disable auto adjustment and maintain manual settings. z The projected image may become distorted while an auto adjustment operation is in progress. z The [AUTO] key is disabled whenever S-VIDEO, VIDEO, or Component is selected as the input source. z If an image is unclear following the auto adjustment operation, you can use the menu to adjust items manually. For details, see “Image Adjustment” on page 73. 49 Projection Operations Full-screen Display of an RGB Image The projector outputs images using XGA (1024 pixels × 768 pixels) video resolution. When the input signal from the computer connected to the projector is not an XGA signal, “Resize Image To Fit” automatically enlarges or reduces the image so it matches the projector’s video resolution and fills the entire screen. The following shows how different input signals from a computer are adjusted during projection. z Resizing of an input image by “Resize Image To Fit” can call coarsening of the image or can cause part of the image to be cut off. If this happens, try turning off “Resize Image To Fit”. See “Screen Settings J Resize Image to Fit” on page 81 for more information. Input Signal Example Projected Image 800 × 600 1024 × 768 1280 × 1024 Projection Operations 50 When the projector is at an angle to the screen it is projecting on, the projected image may have different length left and right edges, or top and bottom edges. This phenomenon is called, “keystoning”. This projector comes with functions for automatic as well as manual keystone correction, which provides a regularly shaped projected image. z Keystone correction (auto or manual) can cause dustortion of the projected image. If this happens try moving the screen and/or projector so they are oriented close to the configuration shown under “Setting Up the Projector” on page 28. z Keystone correction can cause the corrected image to be smaller than the original (uncorrected) image. Automatic Keystone Correction Automatic keystone correction correct the image to counteract the effects of vertical keystoning. Performing auto keystone correction causes the message “Auto Keystone Corrected.” to appear in the center of the projected image. Keystone Correction (KEYSTONE) 51 Projection Operations z Note that auto keystone correction is possible within a range of about –30 degrees to +30 degrees. z Auto keystone correction is performed by detecting the elevation angle of the projector. This means that the surface you are projecting onto needs to be standing straight up. If the surface you are projecting onto is not straight, use manual keystone correction to correct the image. z You can turn auto keystone correction on or off as required. For details, see “Option Settings J Auto Keystone Correction” on page 89. z Note that auto keystone correction is not performed for horizontal keystoning. Use manual correction for horizontal keystoning. z Performing manual horizontal keystone correction and then automatic keystone correction can cause the manual horizontal keystone correction value to change, and can magnify horizontal keystoning. This occurs when vertical keystone correction narrows the allowable manual horizontal keystone correction range, causing the manually specified correction value to be outside the correction range. If this happens, rearrange the projector and screen so the lens is pointing straighter at the screen, and then perform manual keystone correction or auto keystone correction again. Screen Up to about 30 degrees Up to about 30 degrees Projection Operations 52 Manual Keystone Correction Manual keystone correction can be used to correct for both vertical and horizontal keystoning. To use manual keystone correction 1. Press the [KEYSTONE] key. z This causes the keystone correction screen to appear on the projected image. 2. Use the [S] and [T] keys to select either “Vertical Keystone Correction” or “Horizontal Keystone Correction”. 3. Use the [W] and [X] keys to correct for keystoning. z Each press of [W] or [X] shifts the indicator on the currently selected bar left or right. z Keystone correction is possible within the range that the indicator is able to move within the selected bar. Depending on conditions, the indicator may not move all the way to either end of the bar. z Repeat steps 2 and 3 to perform keystone correction for the other direction, if you want. 4. After the settings are the way you want, press the [ESC] key or the [KEYSTONE] key. z This causes the keystone correction screen to disappear. 53 Projection Operations z The allowable ranges for manual keystone correction are –30 to +30 degrees vertically, and –8 to +8 degrees horizontally. z Performing horizontal keystone correction and then vertical keystone correction can cause the horizontal keystone correction value to change. This occurs when vertical keystone correction narrows the allowable manual horizontal keystone correction range, causing the horizontal keystone correction value to be outside the correction range. If this happens, rearrange the projector and screen so the lens is pointing straighter at the screen, and then perform manual keystone correction or auto keystone correction again. You can use the remote controller keys to adjust the volume level of the audio that is output from the projector’s speaker. To adjust the volume level 1. On the remote controller, press the [VOL +] or [VOL –] key. z This causes the [Volume] screen to appear on the projected image. 2.

To exit image enlargement and return the image to its original size, press the remote controller’s [ESC] key. Projection Operations 56 While RGB is selected as the input source, you can display a sub-window that simultaneously displays the image being input through the VIDEO or S-VIDEO terminal. This function is called “picture-in-picture” or “P-IN-P”. z The initial default setting for the sub-window input source is VIDEO. Use the setup menu when you want to change the sub-window input source to S-VIDEO. For details, see “Input Settings J P-in-P Input” on page 87. z Note that P-IN-P can be used only when RGB is selected as the input source. It is not available while any other input source is selected. z If Component is selected for “Input Settings J RGB Input” on the setup menu, you need to change the setting to RGB in order to use picture-in-picture. Note that the initial default setting for “Input Settings J RGB Input” is RGB.

Note, however, that the number of signal type settings that can be saved is limited. Exceeding the limit causes the oldest setting to be deleted automatically. IImage Adjustment J Horizontal Position This sub-menu lets you adjust the horizontal position of the input source image within the projection area. z This setting is not possible when there is no input signal. z See “Image Adjustment J Vertical Position” for details about how settings are saved. 77 Using the Setup Menu IImage Adjustment J Frequency This sub-menu lets you manually control the frequency of the image. Normally, the projector is able to adjust the frequency automatically. If there are vertical bands in the projected image, however, it means that automatic adjustment is not possible for some reason. When this happens use this setting to adjust the image frequency. z This setting is possible only when RGB is selected as the input source. z Settings are saved for each signal type (XGA/60Hz, UXGA/60Hz, etc.). Note, however, that the number of signal type settings that can be saved is limited. Exceeding the limit causes the oldest setting to be deleted automatically. z If, for some reason, your manual frequency settings cause the image input from the computer to disappear from the projection, you can press the [AUTO] key to perform an auto adjust operation (page 48), which should cause the image to reappear. IImage Adjustment J Phase This sub-menu lets you manually control the phase of the image. Normally, the projector is able to adjust the phase automatically. If there are color errors or flickering in the projected image, however, it means that automatic adjustment is not possible for some reason. When this happens use this setting to adjust the image phase. z This setting is possible only when RGB is selected as the input source. z See “Image Adjustment J Frequency” for details about how settings are saved. IImage Adjustment J Noise Filter This sub-menu provides a choice of noise filter levels to remove digital noise from the projected image when RGB is selected as the input source. Note that the noise filter may not be able to remove certain types of digital noise. z This setting is possible only when RGB is selected as the input source. The setting is saved for the RGB input source only. z Turning off the projector automatically returns this sub-menu to its initial default setting (Normal). Input Source Specific Menu Items Input Source Available Items (Parentheses indicate defaults.) RGB Low, (Normal), High Component None S-VIDEO VIDEO No Signal Using the Setup Menu 78 IImage Adjustment J Restore Menu Defaults This sub-menu returns all of the sub-menu items on the Image Adjustment main menu to their initial default settings. z You can perform initialization even when there is no input signal. In this case, the initialization is performed for the currently selected input source. z “Image Adjustment” main menu “Vertical Position”, “Horizontal Position”, “Frequency”, and “Phase” settings are initialized for the current signal type (XGA/60Hz, UXGA/60Hz, etc.) only. z For details about the initialization procedure, see “To initialize the settings of a particular main menu item” on page 70. Volume Adjustment IVolume Adjustment J Volume This sub-menu can be used to adjust the volume level of the projector’s speaker. This setting is also linked to volume settings made with the remote controller’s [VOL +] and [VOL –] keys. z Changing this setting when there is no input signal changes the volume setting of the currently selected signal source. z A different setting is stored for each input source. IVolume Adjustment J Restore Menu Defaults This sub-menu returns Volume to its initial default setting. z You can perform initialization even when there is no input signal. In this case, the initialization is performed for the currently selected input source. z Initialization is performed separately for each input source. z For details about the initialization procedure, see “To initialize the settings of a particular main menu item” on page 70. 79 Using the Setup Menu Screen Settings IScreen Settings J Vertical Keystone Correction This sub-menu lets you correct for vertical keystoning of the projected image. z Vertical keystone correction can be performed regardless of the currently selected input source. z A single setting is stored, which is applied to all input sources. IScreen Settings J Horizontal Keystone Correction This sub-menu lets you correct for horizontal keystoning of the projected image. z Horizontal keystone correction can be performed regardless of the currently selected input source. z A single setting is stored, which is applied to all input sources. z Performing horizontal keystone correction and then vertical keystone correction can cause the horizontal keystone correction value to change. This occurs when vertical keystone correction narrows the allowable manual horizontal keystone correction range, causing the horizontal keystone correction value to be outside the correction range. If this happens, rearrange the projector and screen so the lens is pointing straighter at the screen, and then perform manual keystone correction or auto keystone correction again. Using the Setup Menu 80 IScreen Settings J Aspect Ratio This sub-menu lets you select the aspect ratio (ratio between the vertical and horizontal dimensions) of the projected image. Input Source Specific Menu Items Setting Explanations 4:3: Sets the aspect ratio of the projected image to 4:3 (same as a standard TV screen). This setting is normally used when S-VIDEO or VIDEO is selected as the input source. 16:9: Sets the aspect ratio of the projected image to 16:9 (same as a movie screen or high-definition TV screen). Using this setting when the input source image is a 16:9 image that has been squeezed to a 4:3 image causes the image to be projected with its normal 16:9 aspect ratio. Setting Storage A different setting is stored for each input source. z When a component signal with an aspect ratio of 16:9 is sent from the input source, the aspect ratio of the projected image is automatically switched to 16:9. In this case, this setting cannot be changed. z Using this projector to reduce, enlarge, or otherwise alter an image for business purposes or public display may infringe upon the rights of the individual who holds the copyright of the image. Input Source Available Items (Parentheses indicate defaults.) RGB None Component (4:3), 16:9 S-VIDEO VIDEO No Signal None 81 Using the Setup Menu IScreen Settings J Resize Image to Fit When RGB is selected as the input source and the video resolution of the connected computer is anything other than XGA (1024 × 768 pixels), “Resize Image To Fit” automatically enlarges or reduces the input image so it matches the video resolution of the projector and fills the entire screen. Input Source Specific Menu Items Setting Explanations On: When the input signal from the computer connected to the projector is not an XGA signal, the image is automatically enlarged or reduced so it matches the projector’s video resolution and fills the entire screen. Off: Turns off resizing of the image input from the computer. If the image input from the computer is smaller than XGA, the size of the projected image will also be smaller. When the image input from the computer is larger than XGA, only the center part of the image that corresponds to XGA size is projected. z Resizing of an input image by “Resize Image To Fit” can call coarsening of the image or can cause part of the image to be cut off. If this happens, try turning off “Resize Image To Fit”. Note, however, that turning off “Resize Image To Fit” can cause the projected image to become smaller, or it can cause only the center part of the image to be projected. Setting Storage This setting is possible only when RGB is selected as the input source. The setting is saved for the RGB input source only.

The projection angle of the projector can be adjusted between 0 and 8 degrees, and minor adjustments can also be made to the left and right angles if needed. The operation process is as follows: first, lift the front part of the projector and press the release button.

When you turn on the projector for the first time, a language selection window will be projected. You can use the arrow keys to highlight the language you want to use. Once the language is set, it cannot be changed permanently, so users should choose carefully. C. When focusing the image displayed by the projector, it should be done using a non-static image. Typically, zooming after focusing will not change the focus of the image. You can use the zoom function to adjust the projection position and screen size. D. The projector has an internal lamp, and after approximately 2000 hours of use, the LAMP indicator will start flashing red, indicating that the lamp has reached its replacement period. At this time, you need to turn off the projector and unplug the AC power cord. Wait 60 minutes for the lamp to fully cool down, then turn the projector upside down, loosen the lamp cover, remove the screws fixing the lamp box, pull out the lamp box, insert the new lamp, secure the screws, and reattach the lamp cover.

Box 513, 5600 MB Eindhoven, The Netherlands (Received 25 April 2014; published 31 July 2014) A drop of water deposited on a cold plate freezes into an ice drop with a pointy tip. While this phenomenon clearly finds its origin in the expansion of water upon freezing, a quantitative description of the tip singularity has remained elusive. Here we demonstrate how the geometry of the freezing front, determined by heat transfer considerations, is crucial for the tip formation. We perform systematic measurements of the angles of the conical tip, and reveal the dynamics of the solidification front in a Hele- Shaw geometry. It is found that the cone angle is independent of substrate temperature and wetting angle, suggesting a universal, self-similar mechanism that does not depend on the rate of solidification. We propose a model for the freezing front and derive resulting tip angles analytically, in good agreement with the experiments. DOI: 10.1103/PhysRevLett.113.054301 PACS numbers: 47.20.Ft Liquid solidification can lead to intricate morphological structures, from dendritic growth [1] to the fascinating complexity of snowflakes [2]. In an apparently much simpler situation of a water drop freezing on a cold substrate, it has been observed that the final shape of the ice drop is pointy [3–6], with a sharp tip that is reminiscent of the domes of orthodox churches (Fig. 1). Intriguingly, the sharp tip appears despite the presence of liquid surface tension, which usually tends to smooth out sharp features. These singular ice drops can be observed in frozen water accretion on aircraft cabins during flights [7], during solidification for freeze drying purposes [8], and in recent studies on supercooling [9] and icing of substrates [10]. A similar mechanism is thought to be at the origin of the formation of spiky microstructures following the irradiation by high-power ultrashort lasers in germanium and silicon substrates [11], which like water are materials that expand upon freezing. Though the formation of pointy ice drops has been attributed to the expansion of water upon freezing, there is still no satisfactory explanation for this phenomenon. Previous studies revealed that the freezing can indeed yield a tip singularity, by modeling a planar solidification front reaching the top of the drop [3,5]. However, these theories predict a singularity only when the ratio of solid and liquid densities is below 0.75: this clearly does not explain the appearance of conical ice drops, since for water ν≡ρs=ρl ¼ 0.92. The paradox can be resolved by assuming that the freezing dynamics induces a contact angle, with a slope discontinuity at the solid-liquid-air trijunction point that depends on the freezing rate [3]. Alternatively, the singularity was also recovered for realistic ν when numerically treating the solidification dynamics in full detail, but without the assumption of a dynamic co FIG. 1 (color online).

The true mechanism behind the tip singularity has therefore remained elusive, in particular since there is a lack of systematic experiments to which any of the theories can be compared. In this Letter we reveal that the geometry of the freezing front, essentially determined by the final stages of a quasisteady heat transfer problem, is responsible for the formation of pointy ice drops. First, we experimentally show that the cone angles at the tip are universal, and do not depend on the substrate temperature, excluding the influence of the solidification rate. Next, we reveal the boundary conditions of the solidification front by tracking the freezing process in a Hele-Shaw geometry. It is found experimentally, and explained theoretically from heat con- duction, that the front develops a spherical shape that ends perpendicularly to the solid-air interface. Taking this into account into the mass balance during solidification, we then show how the singularity emerges for any density ratio ν < 1. The theory predicts a cone angle α ¼ 131° for water drops [α defined in Fig. 1(c)], which falls within the range of experimental observations. Experiments.—Droplets of pure water (milli-Q, degassed) were frozen on a copper structure that is partially immersed in a cooling bath composed of ethylene-glycol, ethanol, and dry ice [Fig. 1(a)]. With this mixture, the temperature can be controlled in the range −78 to −17 °C by modifying the volume fraction of the two liquids [13]. Droplets of volume 4–8 μl were deposited using a syringe pump (Harvard Apparatus PHD ULTRA) and a 200 μm capillary. The temperature on the plate was measured near the droplet using a thermocouple. We focus here on temperatures above −44 °C, for which reproducible experi- ments could be performed. At lower temperatures nondi- rectional freezing and multiple freezing fronts appear. The freezing process was recorded, using a PCO camera (Sensicam QE), a long distance microscope (Edmund Optics VZM1000), and diffused back lighting, until the tip was formed. We extracted the final shape of the drops through image analysis and fitted third-order polynomials to the left-hand and right-hand regions close to the tip. The angle of the tip is then computed as the intersecting angle of the poly- nomials, with an experimental error bar of 5° on average. The total time for the solidification is on the order of 1 sec for the coldest cases and 10 sec for the warmest. Importantly, the liquid near the contact line freezes long before reaching the equilibrium contact angle, so that different contact angles can be achieved by varying the height of deposition. This results in drops of different aspect ratio H=R, where H is defined as the final height of the ice drop and R the radius of the wetted area [see Fig 2(a) for geometric definitions and Fig. 2(b) for typical droplet shapes]. Various movies of the freezing process can be found as Supplemental Material [14]. Figure 2(b) shows typical shapes of ice drops, as obtained for different temperatures and contact angles. Despite the large disparity of drop shapes, the formation of the tip singularity appears to be independent of contact angle and substrate temperature. This can be inferred from Fig. 2(c), where we report the cone angle α for more than 200 experiments, carried out at different temperatures (horizontal axis) and for different aspect ratios (upward or downward symbols). All measurements fall within a well-defined range of tip angles, characterized by an average and standard deviation α ¼ 139°  8°. The data give no evidence for any correlation of α with temperature and aspect ratio. The experiments thus show that the tip formation is not influenced by global geometry of the drop, FIG. 2 (color online). Tip formation on freezing drops. (a) Sketch of the geometry during the final stages of the freezing process. θ is the angle formed by the liquid interface with the horizontal, ϕ is that formed by the solid-frozen interface with the horizontal, and α is the final tip angle. The drop radius R, and the “downward volume” Vd are also defined. (b) Drops with different contact angles (i.e., aspect ratios) are achieved by changing the deposition height, at different temperatures. (c) Measurement of the tip angle α for the full range of temperatures explored. Base-down triangles represent data from droplets at high contact angles and therefore a height-to-radius aspect ratio H=R > 1. Base-up triangles represent drops with low contact angle characterized by aspect ratios H=R < 1. We find no systematic dependence of α with global drop shape and substrate temperature. The gray line indicates the theoretical prediction (4).

The observed variability in α is beyond the accuracy of the measurement, and appears to be due to the conditions in which the experiments were performed, i.e., with the droplet exposed to air currents and vapor from the cooling bath. Freezing front.—To obtain further insight in the tip formation, we next investigate the shape of the solidifica- tion front. The still images in Fig. 1(c) suggest that the front does not remain planar, as was also discussed in Refs. [15,16]. However, in order to achieve quantitative access to the advancing front, we constructed a Hele-Shaw cell with two microscope slides separated by a 1 mm spacer [Fig. 1(b)]. The cell was placed on the copper plate and the capillary carefully maneuvered between the walls. The gap is wide enough for the drop to form a conical tip, but this is not always visible due to the presence of a wetting meniscus. To minimize image distortion due to this meniscus, the glass is treated such that the wetting contact angle ≈90°. This gives a clear view on the quasi-two- dimensional freezing process—typical videos can be found in the Supplemental Material [14]. Figure 3(a) shows that the solidification front in the Hele-Shaw cell grows towards the top of the drop in a similar fashion to the unconfined experiment, although the time scale of the process is a bit faster. In the first instants of the process, vapor condensates on the glass slides resulting in a “frost halo” [9] around the drop. Such an event occurs simultaneously as the partial and kinetically controlled recalescent freezing [17], also visible in Fig. 3(a) as a brighter area above the freezing front. Our prime interest here is to extract quantitative infor- mation on the geometry of the freezing front. The front shown in Fig. 3(a) has a convex shape at the early stage of the freezing, while at the last stages the curvature it is inverted towards a concave geometry. Interestingly, these profiles closely resemble two-dimensional numerical sim- ulations [4]. At all times, the experimentally observed freezing front appears to be perpendicular to the ice-air interface. This is confirmed in Fig. 3(c), where we present the angle γ ¼ θ þ ϕ defined in Fig. 3(b), as a function of the height z of the trijunction point. The red line corre- sponds to the average over 20 experiments, performed at temperatures ranging from −30 to −15 °C. We find that the front is nearly perpendicular during the entire experiment. During the final stages we find an average and standard deviation γ ¼ 87°  8°. Heat-transfer-limited self-similar freezing dynamics.— Coming back to the axisymmetric case we now derive the shape of the solid-liquid front from the heat transfer in the late stages of the freezing process [cf. Fig. 2(a)]. We neglect any small-scale kinetic undercooling or Gibbs-Thomson effect (as considered, e.g., in Ref. [12]), such that the front here always remains at the equilibrium melting temperature Tm. As the air surrounding the drop has a much smaller thermal conductivity than the solid (and the liquid), the latent heat released by the advancing front must be FIG. 3 (color online).

(b) Sketch and definitions of angles and distances. (c) Front-to-interface angle γ plotted against the relative height of the freezing front z=H. Within experimental variations, we find γ ≈90°. PRL 113, 054301 (2014) P H Y S I C A L R E V I E W L E T T E R S week ending 1 AUGUST 2014 054301-3 evacuated via the solid, while the liquid remains at uniform temperature Tm. The fact that heat cannot cross the solid-air boundary has an important consequence: it implies that the isotherms, in particular the freezing front at Tm, are locally perpendicular to the solid-air boundary, i.e., γ ¼ 90°. This simple argument is in good agreement with the Hele-Shaw cell experiments, even though heat transfer via the glass slides might not be entirely negligible there. The final stages of the heat transfer are expected to be self-similar. Namely, the angle γ made by the front with the external surface remains approximately constant, and the freezing is characterized by a single length scale r, the radius at the triple junction [Fig. 2(b)]. Based on this length, one can derive a scaling law for the normal velocity vn of the front, which is proportional to the rate at which latent heat released by the front is evacuated. This gives vn ∼−dr=dt∼ λsδT=ρsLmr, where λs is the solid thermal conductivity, Lm is the latent heat of melting, and the undercooling δT ¼ Tm −T. Here we assumed that the heat transfer process in the solid is quasisteady, i.e., that the time scale of front motion r=vn is much larger than the thermal diffusion time scale r2=κs, where κs is the thermal diffusivity of the solid. Taking into account that κs ¼ λs=ρscp;s, where cp;s is the thermal capacity of the solid, this is equivalent to assuming that the Stefan number S ¼ cp;sδT=Lm is small [4]. Actually, we find S ¼ 0.27 for the maximal value of δT ¼ 44 K in our experiments, such that this quasisteadi- ness assumption is sufficiently accurate here [as also con- firmed in Fig. 2(c)]. Note that solving the above energy balance for r leads to a classical r2 law; i.e., r2 decreases linearly with time during tip formation. The above theory also provides the self-similar shape of the freezing front, which is crucial for understanding the tip formation. The heat transfer problem amounts to solving ∇2T ¼ 0 in the solid, with the boundary condition that the isotherms make an angle γ ¼ 90°. When the solid approaches a conical shape, the resulting isotherms are portions of concentric spheres centered at the final cone tip [Fig. 2(a)]. The two-dimensional equivalent is that the freezing front is a portion of a circle—in good agreement with the concave shape in the final stage [Fig. 3(a)]. This solution is stable with respect to dendrite formation given that cooling is from the solid side [1]. Hence, the front will remain spherical during the self-similar final stages of tip formation. Geometric theory for tip formation.—The results above point towards a scenario where the tip is formed by a quasistatic mechanism. Based on this, we propose a model in the spirit of Ref. [3], but taking into account the self- similar spherical geometry of the freezing front. The starting point is mass conservation d dz ðVl þ νVsÞ ¼ 0; ð1Þ here expressed in terms of liquid and solid volumes Vl;s and density ratio ν. Since temporal dynamics is unimportant, the conservation law has been written in terms of a derivative with respect to z, the height of the trijunction. The total liquid volume can be decomposed into a spherical cap of angle θ and a downward volume Vd [cf. Fig. 2(a)]. The liquid and solid volumes then are Vl ¼ r3fðθÞ þ Vd; Vs ¼ −Vd þ Z z 0 dz0πrðz0Þ2; ð2Þ where rðzÞ and θðzÞ are the local radius and angle of the frozen drop, and the geometry of a spherical cap gives fðθÞ ¼ π 3 2–3 cos θ þ cos3θ sin3θ  : ð3Þ Closing the problem requires an expression for Vd, which in general implies a full solution of the solidification front. For the final stages, however, we can take advantage of our previous observation that the front develops a spherical shape with downward angle ϕ ¼ γ −θ, such that Vd ¼ r3fðγ −θÞ. With this, and taking into account that dr=dz ¼ −1= tan θ, Eqs. (1)–(3) give a closed set of equations for rðzÞ, indeed predicting a sharp tip as r→0 [18]. At the singularity, θ obeys fðγ −θÞ þ fðθÞ ¼ ν  fðγ −θÞ þ π 3 tan θ  ; ð4Þ from which we can infer α ¼ π −2θ, for any density ratio. The central result of this analysis is that, combined with our result that γ ¼ 90°, Eq. (4) gives a parameter-free prediction for the tip angle of ice drops: α ¼ 131°. This is consistent with our experimental observation α ¼ 139°8°, though most experiments are slightly above the theoretical prediction. We tentatively attribute the experimentally observed variability in the cone angle to variations of γ. Inserting the γ variations measured in the Hele-Shaw cell in Eq. (4) indeed gives α ¼ 133°  5°, in close agreement with experiments. Equation (4) has an elegant interpretation in terms of the volumes before and after freezing. After multiplication by r3, the left-hand side represents the unfrozen liquid volume, consisting of two spherical caps. This mass is to be transformed into ice, where due to the expansion factor ν the upward liquid sphere is transformed into a cone of volume ðπ=3Þr3 tan θ. The tip angle is thus determined from purely geometrical considerations. Interestingly, the model does not display a critical density ratio: a tip is formed even for 0 < 1 −ν ≪1. This can be seen by expansion of Eq. (4), yielding a nonzero angle θ ¼ ð12=πÞfðγÞð1 −νÞ, in radians. This is in marked contrast with the model where the solidification front was assumed PRL 113, 054301 (2014) P H Y S I C A L R E V I E W L E T T E R S week ending 1 AUGUST 2014 054301-4 planar [3,5], which predicted tip formation only for ν below a critical value 3=4. Outlook.—This offers a fundamentally new view of freezing phenomena near free surfaces, valid beyond the ice-cone formation studied here: our findings provide the first direct measurement of the boundary condition for the freezing front, and highlight that geometric aspects are more critical than dynamical effects. The confinement of heat transfer within the solid-liquid system is a generic feature of solidification near free surfaces. The results are therefore expected to have impact on a broad variety of applications, such as icing, drop impact on cold surfaces, and solidification during 3D printing. A. G. M. and O. R.

Indeed, the versatile transformations and fascinating morphologies of the droplets have been identified, which primarily arise from the evaporation- induced flow. Here, we report the self-lifting behavior of a frozen binary droplet, resulting in a nearly doubling in height, in a fashion that defies against the gravitational effect. This counterintuitive observation is attributed to an internal solutal Marangoni flow up to 1 mm=s, which is driven by the enriched solute concentration locally in the vicinity of the solidification front. Moreover, we perform theoretical analysis by incorporating the propagation of solidification front, and the calculated spatiotemporal evolution of droplet shape agrees with experiments excellently. The effects of several key physical parameters on self-lifting are elucidated quantitatively, providing guidance to control the self-lifting. These results will further advance our understanding of underlying physicochemical hydrodynamics in the multicomponent liquid systems subjected to heat transfer and phase change, consequently shedding light on the relevant technological applications. DOI: 10.1103/PhysRevLett.132.014002 Multicomponent droplets consisting of more than one liquid component [1–3] are indispensable for diverse appli- cations, including 3D printing [4,5], fabrication of electronic devices [6], and medical diagnostics [7]. Since being inherent with the rich physicochemical hydrodynamics, multicomponent droplets are typically characterized by the occurrence of the phase transition in the manifestation of evaporation and solidification [1]. Particularly, the evaporation at the air-liquid interface of the droplets has been extensively investigated recently. This evaporation generates the gradient of the solute concentration and the gradientof surface tension,and the internal flow accordingly leads to the intriguing dynamics and exotic phenomena. For example, in a volatile colloidal droplet, an outward capillary flow carries dispersed particles, which accumulate toward the pinned contact line, and deposits them into a line to form the residual coffee rings [8]. The evaporation-induced Marangoni flow within a binary-mixture liquid droplet is strong enough to generate a micron-thick pancakelike shape [9]. Because of selective evaporation and the density gradient, the flow within droplets is effectively controlled by the gravitational effect [10]; a protein-containing droplet experiences the shape morphing to a flattened and wrinkled encapsulated state due to the gravity and evaporation [11]. Concurrently, the study of frozen droplets undergoing supercooling has been emerging [12]. Since the advancing solidification front is immanent in phase change, heat transfer, and mass transport, generating an intimate inter- action with the dispersed objects submerged within the liquid, many fascinating behaviors can appear. For example, a water droplet on a supercooling substrate will form an ice- cone shape associated with the geometry of the freezing front as determined by heat transfer [13]. For an oil-in-water emulsion during freezing process, the increased solute concentration at the solidification front can enhance pre- melting for the engulfment of droplets [14], and the droplet can be formed into a pointy-tip shape as mediated by nanometer-thick interfacial flows [15]. Despite the signifi- cant progresses of evaporation-induced solutal Marangoni flow for the multicomponent liquid, the effects of solidifi- cation on the probable flow and shape transformation in the multicomponent liquids have been less investigated. In this Letter, by utilizing the high-speed imaging and thermal imaging, we observe a counterintuitive self-lifting behavior for a water-ethanol binary droplet subjected to supercooling, resulting in a nearly doubling in height, in a fashion that defies the gravitational effect. This phenome- non is attributed to an internal solidification-induced solutal Marangoni flow, which deforms the shape to be elevated upward. A theoretical model agrees with the experiments remarkably, and the effects of several key physical param- eters on the self-lifting are elucidated quantitatively. These results would inspire more future research to explore solidification-induced flow for the relevant technological applications. Observation of the self-lifting behavior.—A binary ethanol-water droplet (the initial volume concentration of ethanol c0) was gently deposited on a supercooled surface (the substrate temperature Ts), and the freezing dynamics is sketched in Fig. 1(a) (Supplemental Material [16], Note 1). PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS 132, 014002 (2024) 0031-9007=24=132(1)=014002(5) 014002-1 © 2024 American Physical Society By utilizing high-speed camera and thermal camera, the spatiotemporal evolution of the freezing dynamics was recorded at various ethanol concentrations [Figs. 1(b)–1(e), Supplemental Material, Movie S1–4). For a pure water droplet [Fig. 1(b)], during the whole freezing process from t ¼ 0 to tf, the transition between the solid-gas interface and the liquid-gas interface at the solidification front is so smooth that the initial droplet profile is nearly preserved in the final frozen shape, although the volume expansion causes a sharp tip at the apex of the droplet [13]. However, for a binary droplet [Figs. 1(c)–1(e)], the interface transition at the solidification front is so sharp that the different contact angles at the solid-gas interface (θlow) and the liquid-gas interface (θup) form a pronounced dynamic growth angle (Δθdyn), as indicated in the sketch of Fig. 1(a) [17]. The top residual droplet above the solidi- fication front undergoes deformation and lifting up. Eventually at tf, the final height of a frozen binary droplet (Hf) is much greater than the initial height (H0). From the high-speed imaging, the total height (Ht) of the droplet as a function of time is obtained, as shown in Fig. 2(a), and the final self-lifting behavior as characterized by a dimensionless height ratio, Hf=H0, has a nonmono- tonic relation with the concentration c0, and reaches a peak at a medium concentration (c0 ¼ 0.05) [Fig. 2(b)]. Since the surface tension of the ethanol-water binary mixture decreases with ethanol concentration c0 (Supplemental Material, Note 2), the initial apparent contact angle of the binary droplet θ0 on the supercooled surface is expected to decrease with c0 accordingly, consistent with the experi- ments [Fig. 2(c)]. Propagation of solidification front.—In order to under- stand the freezing dynamics of a binary droplet, the solidification front is simplified to be flat hereafter [dashed lines in Figs. 1(c)–1(e)]. By considering the balance between the latent heat released at the solidification front and the heat transfer across the solid, the height of solidification front (Hs) grows with time as follows [13,18]: Hs ¼ 2 ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ Dst p ; ð1Þ (b) (c) (d) (e) (a) FIG. 1.

The propagation of the solidification front [Fig. 2(d)] still can be well described by this 1=2 scaling law for the ice front propagation in a pure liquid. Additionally, this scaling law is experimentally validated by the effective diffusivity H2 f=tf ¼ 4Ds ∼ΔT at different supercooling temperatures ΔT, while being independent of ethanol concentration c0, as shown in Fig. 2(e) [18,19]. Solutal Marangoni flow.—For a multicomponent droplet such as a binary ethanol-water droplet investigated here, as shown in the sketch [Fig. 3(a)], during the freezing process, the solute (ethanol) is extruded from the solidification front due to the lower freezing point [14]. By this fashion, the solutal concentration is accumulated locally near the vicinity of the solidification front in the liquid phase, so the solute concentration is enhanced near the solidification front (chigh), while the concentration at the top liquid is less (clow). Since the surface tension decreases with ethanol concentration, accordingly the local surface tension at the bottom liquid (γlow) is reduced to be lower than the surface tension at the top liquid (γhigh). Consequently, a solutal Marangoni flow is generated within the liquid phase, resulting in an upward solutal Marangoni flow at the droplet interface while a downward flow inside the droplet, as marked by yellow arrows in Fig. 3(a). In order to validate the solutal Marangoni flow, particle image velocimetry (PIV) measurement is performed during the freezing process of a binary droplet. Figure 3(b) shows a typical snapshot of flow field in a frozen binary droplet (c0 ¼ 0.05), and a pronounced downward flow field at the center of the droplet is observed. In contrast, the flow field inside a frozen pure water droplet is opposite to the binary case, and this upward flow at the center of the droplet [Fig. 3(c)] arises from the thermal Marangoni effect due to the interfacial temperature gradient [20]. Furthermore, the downward flow pattern at the center of a freezing binary droplet [Fig. 3(d)] is validated by the simulation involving the solutal Marangoni flow due to concentration gradient [Fig. 3(e) and Supplemental Material, Note 3). Also, the simulation presents the flow structure near the interface, which is challenging to be measured accurately for the curved or distorted interface [20]. Because of the existence of the upward solutal Marangoni flow, the profile of droplet differs pronouncedly from the initial profile. The apparent contact angle of the droplet on the ice substrate (θup) becomes larger than the angle of the ice substrate (θlow), and a dynamic growth angle Δθdyn ¼ θup −θlow is identified (Fig. 3(a)). The typical solutal Marangoni velocity Um inside a freezing binary droplet is defined as the maximum velocity at the center of the droplet, marked by the white dash box in Fig. 3(d). As shown in Fig. 3(f), both Δθdyn and Um decrease with the propagation of the solidification front experimentally. From the perspective of scaling analysis, by balancing the viscous force with the surface tension gradient [1,9], the typical velocity of the Marangoni flow can be expressed as, UM ∝Δγðc; TÞHl μRl ; ð2Þ where Δγðc; TÞ is the difference of surface tension, which can be induced by a temperature gradient or a concentration gradient, μ is the viscosity of the liquid, Hl and Rl are the height and radius of the remaining droplet in the phase of liquid, respectively. Additionally, the competition between the thermal Marangoni effect ΔγT and the solutal Marangoni effect Δγc can be expressed as follows: ΔγT Δγc ∼jdγ=dTj · ðT0 −TfÞ=R0 jdγ=dcj · c0=δc ; ð3Þ where jdγ=dTj¼2×10−4 N=ðmKÞ, jdγ=dcj ¼ 0.1 N=m are the surface tension gradients dependent on temperature (a) (d) (e) (f) (b) (c) FIG. 3.

During the propagation of the solidification front, the solute (ethanol) concentration at the front (chigh) is accumulated and enriched, becoming greater than the concentration at the apex (clow). Consequently, the concen- tration-dependent surface tension (red arrow) generates a solutal Marangoni flow (yellow arrow), forming an upward solutal Marangoni flow UM along the interface.

PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS 132, 014002 (2024) 014002-3 and concentration, respectively. δc is the thickness of the concentration boundary layer, which is typically much smaller than the radius of droplet R0 [14]. Hence, the resultant ΔγT=Δγc ≪1 evidently indicates the dominant role of the solutal Marangoni effect in the frozen binary droplet as investigated here. According to Eq. (2), the decrease of Um as the solidification front propagates [Fig. 3(f)] may result from the decreased aspect ratio Hl=Rl and the reduced surface tension gradient dγ=dc associated with the increased concentration inside the remaining droplet (Supplemental Material, Note 2). This scaling relation of the solutal Marangoni flow UM [Eq. (2)] is further validated by the simulation (Supplemental Material, Note 3). Moreover, we explore the self-lifting behavior on an inclined surface with tilt angle θs ¼ 45° (Supplemental Material, Note 4), and the dimensionless time-dependent height of the freezing droplet Ht=H0 exhibits a similar behavior, implying the negligible gravitational effect and further highlighting the essential role of the solutal Marangoni flow to be responsible for the self-lifting. Dynamic growth angle.—After understanding the char- acteristic of the solutal Marangoni flow inside a freezing binary droplet, we further investigate the dynamic growth angle Δθdyn at different volume concentration c0. From the high-speed images [Figs. 1(c)–1(e)], the evolution of the apparent contact angle of the remaining droplet θup and the ice substrate θlow are extracted at different concentrations c0 [Figs. 4(a)–4(c)]. Remarkably, despite the complicated evolution of the apparent contact angles during the frozen process, the dynamic growth angle Δθdyn is still pro- nounced [Fig. 4(d)]. Figure 4(e) indicates that the time-averaged Δθdyn reaches a peak at a medium concentration (c0 ¼ 0.05). According to Eq. (2), for a lower concentration (c0 < 0.05), the surface tension difference Δγ is dominant, which increases with the initial concentration c0, promoting the solutal Marangoni flow and dynamic growth angle Δθdyn. On the other hand, for a higher concentration (c0 > 0.05), the aspect ratio Hl=Rl, which is dependent on the initial apparent contact angle θ0, becomes much smaller with the increased con- centration c0, suppressing the solutal Marangoni flow and Δθdyn. Model for self-lifting.—In order to understand the self- lifting behavior quantitatively, we proceed to perform the theoretical calculation for the evolution of the droplet shape during the freezing process. The dynamic growth angle associated with the self-lifting is required to be considered carefully. Actually, a general framework to describe solidi- fication was established by including the dynamic growth angle, which is the angle between the tangents to the solid- vapor and liquid-vapor interfaces at the tri-junction [17,21]. Here, by combining the mass conservation, the propaga- tion of solidification front [Eq. (1)], and the geometrical relation [Fig. 3(a)] (Supplemental Material, Note 5), the contour of a frozen binary droplet can be calculated with the initial profile of the droplet R0, θ0, and the constant Δθdyn [17,21]. Here, to simplify the model, the dynamic growth angle Δθdyn correlated with the solutal Marangoni flow is assumed to be a constant during the freezing process, and its value is obtained from the experiments [Fig. 4(e)]. Remarkably, Fig. 5(a) shows the theoretical calculation of droplet profiles agrees with the experimental observation (a) (d) (e) (b) (c) FIG. 4. Dynamic growth angle of a frozen binary droplet.

PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS 132, 014002 (2024) 014002-4 excellently during the solidification process (Supplemental Material, Movie S5). More physical parameters can be examined for the final self-lifting height ratio in the model. Taken as an example, Fig. 5(b) demonstrates the self-lifting height ratio (Hf=H0) as a function of the ratio of solid and liquid density ratio (ρs=ρl) for different Δθdyn. The red and blue regimes denote for the self-lifting (Hf=H0 > 1) and self-shrinking (Hf=H0 < 1). Clearly, for water with ρs=ρl ¼ 0.917, the self-lifting effect becomes much higher at a large Δθdyn. From the model calculation, Fig. 5(c) displays the self- lifting ratio Hf=H0 associated with the initial contact angle (θ0) and the dynamic growth angle (Δθdyn). The self-lifting value at different concentrations (c0), corresponding to (θ0, Δθdyn) as observed experimentally, exhibits excellent agreement with calculation. In conclusion, we report a counterintuitive self-lifting in a frozen binary droplet in a fashion that defies the gravitational effect. This observation is attributed to an internal solutal Marangoni flow, which is driven by the enriched solute concentration locally in the vicinity of the solidification front. We perform theoretical analysis of spatiotemporal evolution of frozen droplet, consistent with experiments excellently. These results will further advance our understanding of the rich physicochemical hydrody- namics in the multicomponent liquid systems subjected to heat transfer and phase change, consequently shedding light on the relevant technological applications for the advanced manufacturing.

It is known that a universal pointy tip is formed on the top of a frozen water droplet [Mar ın et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 113(5), 054301 (2014)]. Here, we report that the formation of a pointy tip is broken down due to the presence of nanoparticles; instead, the top of a frozen nanoﬂuid droplet exhibits a ﬂat plateau shape and such a plateau becomes larger at higher particle concentrations. We show that the phenomenon of such shape changes in freezing nanoﬂuid droplets is universal, independent of contact angle, droplet volume, particle size, and particle material. We propose an analytical model to attribute the plateau formation to a capillary driven compensating ﬂow due to segregated particles moving along the freezing interface. Published under license by AIP Publishing. https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0044935 Liquid solidiﬁcation in droplet form has been widely studied to understand the phenomenon of heat transfer with phase change. In particular, the freezing of a water droplet on a cold substrate has been studied intensively over decades due to its relevance to nature and many application processes such as aircraft icing, freezing drying, frost formation in the refrigeration, and cryogenic systems.1–5 Existing stud- ies have shown the complex physics and unorthodox behaviors of water during solidiﬁcation.6–15 Intriguingly, a unique behavior is that the frozen water droplet expands, yielding a tip singularity despite the presence of liquid surface tension.16 Moreover, several interesting phe- nomena were reported: the frost halos formed from freezing a sessile subcooled water droplet,17 the explosion of a partially frozen droplet,18 and the self-dislodging of water droplets upon freezing19 are a few to name. The freezing of colloidal (i.e., the liquid ﬂuid with dispersed nanoparticles) droplets is relatively an unexplored research area, mak- ing it an intriguing topic from the physical viewpoint. Only a few very speciﬁc cases have been explored, for instance, the freezing of liquid marbles, i.e., liquid cores covered with a layer of solid particles.20,21 The more general case, where solid particles distribute uniformly in the liquid phase, is still a mystery. Based on existing studies, the kinetic interplay of solid particles and the advancing solidiﬁcation front in bulk are quite established, i.e., particles are either engulfed or segre- gated depending on local thermophysical conditions.22–25 However, what will occur in the presence of another interface (air/water free interface) is quite an unsolved question. The interaction between solid particles, the solidiﬁcation front and the free interface, and how it will affect the outcome of droplet freezing are important points that drive us to dig more on this topic. On top of that, the most intriguing part is whether a frozen nanoﬂuid droplet is still of the shape of a truncated sphere with a pointy tip atop. Here, we report a discovery of shape changes during the freezing of a nanoﬂuid droplet. We ﬁnd that the top of a nanoﬂuid ice droplet exhibits a ﬂat plateau shape and such a plateau gets larger with increas- ing particle concentrations. This is very different from the case of a frozen pure water droplet with a pointy tip formed on the top.16 We demonstrate that the formation of such a ﬂat plateau in frozen nano- ﬂuid droplets is universal because the phenomenon also occurs for Appl.

To explain this phenomenon, we develop a physical model to reveal the underlying mechanism and qualitatively represent the dependence of the shape change on the initial droplet contact angle and particle concentration. We built up an experimental setup to visually study the freezing process of a single nanoﬂuid droplet on a smooth substrate that was maintained at a ﬁxed subcooled temperature of 20 6 0.5 C. More details about the preparation and characterizations of nanoﬂuids and the substrate surface, as well as the description of the experimental setup, are provided in the Materials and Methods section (see the sup- plemental material, Materials and Methods S1–S3, and supplementary material Figs. S1 and S2). A DI water or nanoﬂuid droplet with volume 7.7 6 0.2ll (with a typical radius of R0  1.2 mm) was gently released to deposit on a smooth silicon substrate. The substrate was cleaned following a stan- dard protocol26,27 and maintained at a constant temperature of 20 6 0.5 C. The volume of droplets has little dependence on particle concentration [see supplementary material Fig. S3(a)]. The droplets started freezing upon in contact with the substrate surface as a result of the heterogeneous nucleation occurring spontaneously at the liquid/ solid substrate interface. Figures 1(a)–1(d) show the extracted images of the completely frozen droplets having various particle volumetric concentrations. For the DI water droplet [Fig. 1(a)], the resultant ice droplet is a truncated sphere with a pointy tip, which has been already reported in the literature,16,28 and such a pointy tip is believed to result from the expansion of water upon freezing. The intricate part, how- ever, is a ﬂat plateau formed on the top of ice droplets for the case of nanoﬂuids, even for a small particle concentration of 0.05% v/v [Fig. 1(b)]. The plateau size increases dramatically with an increase in the nanoparticle concentration [Figs. 1(c) and 1(d)]. The equivalent “contact angle” of the ice droplet was h ¼ 52.5 6 3, and it was found to not depend on particle concentration. Though the freezing time is slightly dependent on particle concentration, all droplets freeze completely within no more than 5 s [see supplementary material Fig. S3(b)]. We found that the formation of such a ﬂat plateau for frozen nanoﬂuid droplets is universal because the phenomenon also occurred under other experimental conditions by varying the contact angle [see supplementary material Figs. S4(a) and S4(b)], droplet volume [see supplementary material Figs. S4(c) and S4(d)], particle size [see supplementary material Figs. S4(e) and S4(f)], and particle material [see supplementary material Figs. S4(g), S4(h), and S4(i)]. We also made a comparison of the freezing dynamics between a DI water droplet and a nanoﬂuid droplet that has a moderate particle concentration of 0.3% v/v. Figures 2(a) and 2(b) (Multimedia view), respectively, show the selected snapshots at four different instants during the freezing processes of the DI water and nanoﬂuid droplets. To have a quantitative description of the droplet shape change during the freezing process, we extract the droplet proﬁles by digitalizing the obtained optical images. The extracted proﬁles of the DI water droplet and nanoﬂuid droplet are presented in Figs. 2(c) and 2(d), respectively. For the DI water droplet, the droplet apex propagates upward as a result of the volume expansion upon water freezing. In contrast, for the nanoﬂuid droplet, the droplet apex moves down- ward and even ﬂattens after the freezing completes. Speciﬁcally, it is noted that there is a volume redistribution from the droplet interior to its vertexes for the nanoﬂuid droplet. To explain our experimental ﬁndings shown in Fig. 1, we devel- oped a physical model to illustrate the mechanism underlying this shape change, as shown schematically in Fig. 3(a) (Multimedia view). We formulate the phenomenon to a two-dimensional (3D circular symmetric) Stefan problem with two moving boundaries: active advancing liquid/solid interface and passive air/liquid interface, meaning the morphology of air/liquid interface is modulated by the moving liquid/solid interface. This model includes three steps. First, a consider- able amount of particles is segregated and accumulated in front of the freezing interface, leading to the formation of a porous matrix layer. Second, we assume that this porous matrix layer only moves along the freezing propagation direction, while the liquid residual can spontaneously adjust its proﬁle to minimize the system interfacial energy. This behavior causes the solid component (nanoparticles) to keep pushing over the air/water interface, while the liquid component (base ﬂuid) is solidiﬁed into ice, as shown schematically in Fig. 3(a) and the inset. Finally, a compensating ﬂow is triggered to keep the solid component immersed in liquid, otherwise generating an appreciable amount of additional interfaces, which is energetically unfavorable. Thereby, we attribute the shape change of freezing nanoﬂuid droplets to a net mass transfer (compensating ﬂow) from the droplet interior to its vertexes during the freezing process, matching the dynamic droplet behavior, as indicated in Fig. 2.

We speciﬁcally designed a Hele–Shaw cell on the cryostage and investigated the freezing of nanoﬂuid droplets in this device (see supplementary material Fig. S5). Figure 3(b) (front light) was captured adjacent the moving edge of a freezing nanoﬂuid droplet in the Hele–Shaw cell, showing that most of the nanoparticles are segregated as the freezing interface advances and form an observable solid layer.29,30 By adding very diluted (104% v/v) tracing particles (3.5lm polystyrene beads, Sigma Aldrich), we observe a ﬂow that moves along the freezing inter- face, from droplet interior to its vertexes. A schematic illustration of this radial compensating ﬂow is provided in Fig. 3(c). This mechanism is quite similar to the case of the pining effect induced by the particles in an evaporating colloidal droplet, i.e., the classic “coffee ring” effect.31,32 In both cases, a compensating ﬂow is stimulated due to the presence of accumulated particles. However, the difference is that the liquid component is consumed by the advancing freezing interface in this work, while the liquid component is consumed via vaporization at the air/water interface in the case of the coffee ring effect. Based on this physical description, we can further derive a quan- titative description of the shape change (see the supplementary material model details). Theoretically, we evaluate the magnitude of the compensating ﬂow, dVeff dh  1  v 1  / 2prk cot h; (1) where dVeff is the amount of colloidal suspension that is transported from the droplet interior to its vertexes during the propagation of the freezing interface of a distance of dh; / is the initial particle volume concentration when the system is still homogeneous; v is the particle packing density of the solid matrix layer and usually described as a constant in a list of Refs. 33 and 34; and r, h; and k are the dynamic radius of liquid residual, the dynamic contact angle at the tri-junction, and the thickness of the solid matrix layer, respectively. Experimentally, we use a dimensionless geometric factor b to describe the shape change quantitatively, b  As  Al As ; (2) where Al and AS are the dynamic cross-sectional area of a droplet before and after freezing, respectively. The value of b can be readily obtained from experimental measurements as shown in supplemen- tary material Fig. S6. As modeling deﬁned dVeff dh and measured result b FIG. 2.

(1) and (2), b  dVef f dh . Some dynamic shape change behaviors thereby can be understood. For example, from the model prediction, we can conclude that the mass transfer occurs only when the dynamic contact angle h < p/2, which indicates the larger the ini- tial contact angle h0, the later this mass transfer begins. This feature is veriﬁed by direct experimental measurements, as shown in Fig. 4(a), FIG. 3.

For the case of h0 ¼ 147, the dynamic contact angle h evolves from h0 to p/2 only after the freezing interface propagates over a certain distance. However, for the other two cases of h0 ¼ 89 and h0 ¼ 42, the dynamic contact angle h is smaller than p/2 in the whole freezing process, explaining why a net mass transfer occurs much earlier, i.e., a detectable b. Also, the porous matrix layer thickness k increases with the initial particle concentra- tion / and thus bmax increases with the initial particle concentration. Note bmax here is the maximum value of b obtained at h0. This shape change is independent of particle size, as shown in Fig. 4(b). Additionally, we can forecast that such a compensating ﬂow is stimulated as long as a porous matrix layer locates at the tri-junction region and moves along with the freezing interface. Correspondingly, the droplet shape changes, even when the porous matrix layer is pre- deposited on the surface of liquid droplets, which explains, to date, the mysterious shape change behavior of freezing liquid marbles.21 We have reported that the shape of an ice droplet can vary from a tip singularity for DI water to a truncated cone with different plateau sizes for nanoﬂuids when altering the nanoparticle concentration. By analyzing the evolution of droplet proﬁles and particle segregation dynamics, we attribute the shape change to an outward compensating ﬂow driven by advancing of the accumulated particle layer. The phe- nomenon and the study on its mechanism represent an important advance in our understanding of the droplet phase change in complex systems. This shape control strategy can be generally applied to the solid- iﬁcation of other complex ﬂuids in multifunctional applications, such as solder printing, additive manufacturing, and metallic alloy casting.

A. In the freezing of pure water and ethanol-water mixtures, heat conduction dominates the solidification process, leading to tip formation. In nanofluids, however, the presence of nanoparticles enhances fluid stability at the liquid-solid interface, suppressing local heat diffusion and flattening the solidification front, resulting in a plateau. B. Nanoparticles accumulate along the freezing front during nanofluid solidification, generating capillary-driven compensating flows that counteract the formation of a tip, whereas the solute concentration gradient in ethanol-water mixtures induces an upward Marangoni flow, leading to self-lifting behavior, distinct from the sharp tip seen in pure water. C. In nanofluids, the scattering of heat by nanoparticles lowers the temperature gradient within the droplet, reducing surface tension effects and inhibiting tip formation. In pure water, the higher surface tension maintains the sharp tip structure, while the addition of ethanol creates an asymmetric cooling pattern and localized heat release, encouraging tip formation. D. In nanofluids, nanoparticles cause a non-uniform freezing front that suppresses deformation at the solid-liquid interface, preventing tip formation. By contrast, the freezing front in pure water and ethanol-water mixtures progresses uniformly, with heat diffusion driving tip formation. Answer with only one uppercase letter: A, B, C, or D.

[CONTEXT] Legal case analysis Roe v. Wade, a landmark case for the protection of women's rights and interests, was overruled less than half a century later, and the argument for the decision in this case takes a very different line of thinking from Roe v. Wade.Please read the case details and the court's decision process carefully. Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization “We hold that Roe and Casey must be overruled. The Constitution makes no reference to abortion, and no such right is implicitly protected by any constitutional provision, including the one on which the defenders of Roe and Casey now chiefly rely—the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.”—— Justice Samuel Alito (Majority) Summary Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization was a landmark decision addressing whether the Constitution protects the right to an abortion. In Dobbs, the Supreme Court reviewed the constitutionality of Mississippi’s Gestational Age Act—a law banning most abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy with exceptions for medical emergencies and fetal abnormalities. In a divided opinion, the Court upheld the Mississippi law and overturned Roe v. Wade (1973) and Planned Parenthood v. Casey (1992)—concluding that the Constitution does not protect the right to an abortion. As a result, the Court’s decision returned the issue of abortion regulation to the elected branches. In an opinion concurring in the judgment, Chief Justice Roberts agreed to uphold the Mississippi law, but chided the majority for reaching out to decide the broader question of whether to overrule Roe and Casey. He would have left that important constitutional question to a future case. Finally, in a rare joint dissent, Justices Breyer, Kagan, and Sotomayor criticized the Court for unsettling nearly five decades of precedent and undermining the Constitution’s promise of freedom and equality for women. Read the Full Opinion Excerpt: Majority Opinion, Justice Samuel Alito For the first 185 years after the adoption of the Constitution, each State was permitted to address this issue in accordance with the views of its citizens. Then, in 1973, this Court decided Roe v. Wade. Even though the Constitution makes no mention of abortion, the Court held that it confers a broad right to obtain one. It did not claim that American law or the common law had ever recognized such a right, and its survey ranged from the constitutionally irrelevant (e.g., its discussion of abortion in antiquity) to the plainly incorrect (e.g., its assertion that abortion was probably never a crime under the common law). After cataloging a wealth of other information having no bearing on the meaning of the Constitution, the opinion concluded with a numbered set of rules much like those that might be found in a statute enacted by a legislature. Under this scheme, each trimester of pregnancy was regulated differently, but the most critical line was drawn at roughly the end of the second trimester, which, at the time, corresponded to the point in which a fetus was thought to achieve “viability,” i.e., the ability to survive outside the womb. Although the Court acknowledged that States had a legitimate interest in protecting “potential life,” it found that this interest could not justify any restriction on pre-viability abortions. The Court did not explain the basis for this line, and even abortion supporters have found it hard to defend Roe’s reasoning. At the time of Roe, 30 States still prohibited abortion at all stages. In the years prior to that decision, about a third of States had liberalized their laws, but Roe abruptly ended that political process. It imposed the same highly restrictive regime on the entire Nation, and it effectively struck down the abortion laws of every single State. Eventually, in Planned Parenthood v. Casey, the Court revisited Roe . . . . The opinion concluded that stare decisis, which calls for prior decisions to be followed in most instances, required adherence to what it called Roe’s “central holding”—that a State may not constitutionally protect fetal life before “viability”—even if that holding was wrong. Casey threw out Roe’s trimester scheme and substituted a new rule of uncertain origin under which States were forbidden to adopt any regulation that imposed an ‘undue burden’ on a woman’s right to have an abortion. . . . The three Justices who authored the controlling opinion “call[ed] for the contending sides of a national controversy to end their national division” by treating the Court’s decision as the final settlement of the question of the constitutional right to abortion. As has become increasingly apparent in the intervening years, Casey did not achieve that goal. Americans continue to hold passionate and widely divergent views on abortion, and state legislatures have acted accordingly. Some have recently enacted laws allowing abortion, with few restrictions, at all stage of pregnancy. Others have tightly restricted abortion beginning well before viability. And in this case, 26 States have expressly asked this Court to overrule Roe and Casey and allow the States to regulate or prohibit pre-viability abortions. Before us now is one such state law. The State of Mississippi asks us to uphold the constitutionality of a law that generally prohibits an abortion after the 15th week of pregnancy—several weeks before the point at which a fetus is now regarded as “viable” outside the womb. In defending this law, the State’s primary argument is that we should reconsider and overrule Roe and Casey and once again allow each State to regulate abortion as its citizens wish. On the other side, respondents and the Solicitor General ask us to reaffirm Roe and Casey, and they contend that the Mississippi law cannot stand if we do so. We hold that Roe and Casey must be overruled. The Constitution makes no reference to abortion, and no such right is implicitly protected by any constitutional provision, including the one on which the defenders of Roe and Casey now chiefly rely—the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. That provision has been held to guarantee some rights that are not mentioned in the Constitution, but any such right must be “deeply rooted in this Nation’s history and tradition” and “implicit in the concept of ordered liberty.” The right to abortion does not fall within this category. Until the latter part of the 20th century, such a right was entirely unknown in American law. Indeed, when the Fourteenth Amendment was adopted, three quarters of the States made abortion a crime at all stages of pregnancy. The abortion right is also critically different from any other right that this Court has held to fall within the Fourteenth Amendment’s protection of “liberty.” Roe’s defenders characterize the abortion right as similar to the rights recognized in past decisions involving matters such as intimate sexual relations, contraception, and marriage, but abortion is fundamentally different, as both Roe and Casey acknowledged, because it destroys what those decisions called “fetal life” and what the law now before us describes as an “unborn human being.” Stare decisis, the doctrine on which Casey’s controlling opinion was based, does not compel unending adherence to Roe’s abuse of judicial authority. Roe was egregiously wrong from the start. Its reasoning was exceptionally weak, and the decision has had damaging consequences. And far from bringing about a national settlement of the abortion issue, Roe and Casey have enflamed debate and deepened division. It is time to heed the Constitution and return the issue of abortion to the people’s elected representatives. . . . We discuss [substantive due process] in depth below, but before doing so, we briefly address one additional constitutional provision that some of respondents’ amici have now offered as yet another potential home for the abortion right: the Fourteenth Amendment’s Equal Protection Clause. . . . Neither Roe nor Casey saw fit to invoke this theory, and it is squarely foreclosed by our precedents, which establish that a State’s regulation of abortion is not a sex-based classification and is thus not subject to the “heightened scrutiny” that applies to such classifications. . . . The regulation of a medical procedure that only one sex can undergo does not trigger heightened constitutional scrutiny unless the regulation is a “mere pretex[t] designed to effect an invidious discrimination against members of one sex or the other.” . . . And as the Court has stated, the “goal of preventing abortion” does not constitute “invidiously discriminatory animus” against women. . . . With this new theory addressed, we turn to Casey’s bold assertion that the abortion right is an aspect of the “liberty” protected by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. . . . We begin by considering the critical question of whether the Constitution, properly understood, confers a right to obtain an abortion. . . . The Constitution makes no express reference to a right to obtain an abortion, and therefore those who claim that it protects such a right much show that the right is somehow implicit in the constitutional text. . . . In interpreting what is meant by the Fourteenth Amendment’s reference to ‘liberty,’ we must guard against the natural human tendency to confuse what the Amendment protects with our own ardent views about the liberty that Americans should enjoy. That is why the Court has long been reluctant to recognize rights that are not mentioned in the Constitution. . . . Instead, guided by the history and tradition that map the essential components of our Nation’s concept of ordered liberty, we must ask what the Fourteenth Amendment means by the term “liberty.” When we engage in that inquiry in the present case, the clear answer is that the Fourteenth Amendment does not protect the right to an abortion. Until the latter part of the 20th century, there was no support in American law for a constitutional right to obtain an abortion. No state constitutional provision had recognized such a right. Until a few years before Roe was handed down, no federal or state court had recognized such a right. Nor had any scholarly treatise of which we are aware. And although law review articles are not reticent about advocating new rights, the earliest article proposing a constitutional right to an abortion that has come to our attention was published only a few years before Roe. Not only was there no support for such a constitutional right until shortly before Roe, but abortion had long been a crime in every single State. At common law, abortion was criminal in at least some stages of pregnancy and was regarded as unlawful and could have very serious consequences at all stages. American law followed the common law until a wave of statutory restrictions in the 1800s expanded criminal liability for abortions. By the time of the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment, three-quarters of the States had made abortion a crime at any stage of pregnancy, and the remaining States would soon follow. . . . This overwhelming consensus endured until the day Roe was decided. At that time, also by the Roe Court’s own count, a substantial majority—30 States—still prohibited abortion at all stages except to save the life of the mother. And though Roe discerned a “trend toward liberalization” in about “one-third of the States,” those States still criminalized some abortions and regulated them more stringently than Roe would allow. . . . The inescapable conclusion is that a right to abortion is not deeply rooted in the Nation’s history and traditions. On the contrary, an unbroken tradition of prohibiting abortion on pain of criminal punishment persisted from the earliest days of the common law until 1973 . . . . We next consider whether the doctrine of stare decisis counsels continued acceptance of Roe and Casey . . . . In this case, five factors weigh strongly in favor of overruling Roe and Casey: the nature of their error, the quality of their reasoning, the “workability” of the rules they imposed on the country, their disruptive effect on other areas of the law, and the absence of concrete reliance . . . . [T]o ensure that our decision is not misunderstood or mischaracterized, we emphasize that our decision concerns the constitutional right to abortion and no other right. Nothing in this opinion should be understood to cast doubt on precedents that do not concern abortion . . . . We do not pretend to know how our political system or society will respond to today’s decision overruling Roe and Casey. And even if we could foresee what will happen, we would have no authority to let that knowledge influence our decision. We can only do our job, which is to interpret the law, apply longstanding principles of stare decisis, and decide this case accordingly. We therefore hold that the Constitution does not confer a right to abortion. Roe and Casey must be overruled . . . . We must now decide what standard will govern if state abortion regulations undergo constitutional challenge and whether the law before us satisfies the appropriate standard. . . . Under our precedents, rational-basis review is the appropriate standard for such challenges. . . . We end this opinion where we began. Abortion presents a profound moral question. The Constitution does not prohibit the citizens of each State from regulating or prohibiting abortion. Roe and Casey arrogated that authority. We now overrule those decisions and return that authority to the people and their elected representatives. Excerpt: Concurrence, Justice Brett Kavanaugh Abortion is a profoundly difficult and contentious issue because it presents an irreconcilable conflict between the interests of a pregnant woman who seeks an abortion and the interests of protecting fetal life. The interests on both sides of the abortion issue are extraordinarily weighty. The issue before this Court . . . is not the policy or morality of abortion. The issue before the Court is what the Constitution says about abortion. The Constitution does not take sides on the issue of abortion. . . . On the question of abortion, the Constitution is . . . neither pro-life nor pro-choice. The Constitution is neutral and leaves the issue for the people and their elected representatives to resolve through the democratic process in the States or Congress—like the numerous other difficult questions of American social and economic policy that the Constitution does not address. . . . After today’s decision, the nine Members of this Court will no longer decide the basic legality of pre-viability abortion for all 330 million Americans. . . . But the parties’ arguments have raised other related questions, and I address some of them here. First, is the question of how this decision will affect other precedents involving issues such as contraception and marriage—in particular, the decisions in Griswold v. Connecticut . . . , Eisenstadt v. Baird . . . , Loving v. Virginia . . . , and Obergefell v. Hodges . . . . I emphasize what the Court today states: Overruling Roe does not mean the overruling of those precedents, and does not threaten or cast doubt on those precedents. Second, as I see it, some of the other abortion-related legal questions raised by today’s decision are not especially difficult as a constitutional matter. For example, may a State bar a resident of that State from traveling to another State to obtain an abortion? In my view, the answer is no based on the constitutional right to interstate travel. May a State retroactively impose liability or punishment for an abortion that occurred before today’s decision takes effect? In my view, the answer is no based on the Due Process Clause or the Ex Post Facto Clause. Excerpt: Concurrence, Justice Clarence Thomas I write separately to emphasize a . . . more fundamental reason why there is no abortion right guarantee lurking in the Due Process Clause. Considerable historical evidence indicates that “due process of law” merely requires executive and judicial actors to comply with legislative enactments and the common law when depriving a person of life, liberty, or property. . . . [T]he Due Process Clause at most guarantees process. It does not, as the Court’s substantive due process cases suppose, “forbi[d] the government to infringe certain ‘fundamental’ liberty interests at all, no matter what process is provided.” . . . In future cases, we should reconsider all of this Court’s substantive due process precedents, including Griswold [v. Connecticut], Lawrence [v. Texas], and Obergefell [v. Hodges]. Because any substantive due process decision is “demonstrably erroneous” . . . , we have a duty to “correct the error” established in those precedents . . . . After overruling these demonstrably erroneous decisions, the question would remain whether other constitutional provisions guarantee the myriad rights that our substantive due process cases have generated. For example, we could consider whether any of the rights announced in this Court’s substantive due process cases are “privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States” protected by the Fourteenth Amendment. Substantive due process exalts judges at the expense of the People from whom they derive their authority. . . . In practice, the Court’s approach for identifying those fundamental rights unquestionably involves policymaking rather than neutral legal analysis. The Court divines new rights in line with its own, extraconstitutional value preferences and nullifies state laws that do not align with the judicially created rights. Substantive due process . . . has harmed our country in many ways. Accordingly, we should eliminate it from our jurisprudence at the earliest opportunity. Excerpt: Concurring in the Judgment, Chief Justice John Roberts I would take a more measured course. I agree with the Court that the viability line established by Roe and Casey should be discarded under a straightforward stare decisis analysis. That line never made any sense. Our abortion precedents describe the right at issue as a woman’s right to choose to terminate her pregnancy. That right should therefore extend far enough to ensure a reasonable opportunity to choose, but need not extend any further— certainly not all the way to viability. Mississippi’s law allows a woman three months to obtain an abortion, well be-yond the point at which it is considered “late” to discover a pregnancy… I see no sound basis for questioning the adequacy of that opportunity. But that is all I would say, out of adherence to a simple yet fundamental principle of judicial restraint: If it is not necessary to decide more to dispose of a case, then it is necessary not to decide more. Perhaps we are not always perfect in following that command, and certainly there are cases that warrant an exception. But this is not one of them. Surely we should adhere closely to principles of judicial restraint here, where the broader path the Court chooses entails repudiating a constitutional right we have not only previously recognized, but also expressly reaffirmed applying the doctrine of stare decisis. The Court’s opinion is thoughtful and thorough, but those virtues cannot compensate for the fact that its dramatic and consequential ruling is unnecessary to decide the case before us. . . . Here, there is a clear path to deciding this case correctly without overruling Roe all the way down to the studs: recognize that the viability line must be discarded, as the majority rightly does, and leave for another day whether to reject any right to an abortion at all. . . . Almost all know [about a pregnancy] by the end of the first trimester. Safe and effective abortifacients, moreover, are now readily available, particularly during those early stages. Given all this, it is no surprise that the vast majority of abortions happen in the first trimester. Presumably most of the remainder would also take place earlier if later abortions were not a legal option. Ample evidence thus suggests that a 15-week ban provides sufficient time, absent rare circumstances, for a woman to decide for herself whether to terminate her pregnancy. . . . The Court’s decision to overrule Roe and Casey is a serious jolt to the legal system—regardless of how you view those cases. A narrower decision rejecting the misguided viability line would be markedly less unsettling, and nothing more is needed to decide this case. . . . Both the Court’s opinion and the dissent display a relentless freedom from doubt on the legal issue that I cannot share. I am not sure, for example, that a ban on terminating a pregnancy from the moment of conception must be treated the same under the Constitution as a ban after fifteen weeks. . . . I would decide the question we granted review to answer—whether the previously recognized abortion right bars all abortion restrictions prior to viability, such that a ban on abortions after fifteen weeks of pregnancy is necessarily unlawful. The answer to that question is no, and there is no need to go further to decide this case. Excerpt: Joint Dissent, Justices Stephen Breyer, Elena Kagan, and Sonia Sotomayor For half a century, Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa. v. Casey have protected the liberty and equality of women. Roe held, and Casey reaffirmed, that the Constitution safeguards a woman’s right to decide for herself whether to bear a child. Roe held, and Casey reaffirmed, that in the first stages of pregnancy, the government could not make that choice for women. The government could not control a woman’s body or the course of a woman’s life: It could not determine what the woman’s future would be. Respecting a woman as an autonomous being, and granting her full equality, meant giving her substantial choice over this most personal and most consequential of all life decisions. The Court struck a balance, as it often does when values and goals compete. It held that the State could prohibit abortions until after fetal viability, so long as the ban contained exceptions to safeguard a woman’s life or health. It held that even before viability, the State could regulate the abortion procedure in multiple and meaningful ways. But until the viability line was crossed, the Court held, a State could not impose a “substantial obstacle” on a woman’s “right to elect the procedure” as she (not the government) thought proper, in light of all the circumstances and complexities of her own life. Today, the Court discards that balance. It says that from the very moment of fertilization, a woman has no rights to speak of. . . . One result of today’s decision is certain: the curtailment of women’s rights, and of their status as free and equal citizens. Yesterday, the Constitution guaranteed that a woman confronted with an unplanned pregnancy could (within reasonable limits) make her own decision about whether to bear a child, with all the life-transforming consequences that act involves. And in thus safeguarding each woman’s reproductive freedom, the Constitution also protected “[t]he ability of women to participate equally in [this Nation’s] economic and social life.” . . . But no longer. As of today, this Court holds, a State can always force a woman to give birth, prohibiting even the earliest abortions. A State can thus transform what, when freely undertaken, is a wonder into what, when forced, may be a nightmare. Some women, especially women of means, will find ways around the State’s assertion of power. Others—those without money or childcare or the ability to take time off from work—will not be so fortunate. Maybe they will try an unsafe method of abortion, and come to physical harm, or even die. Maybe they will undergo pregnancy and have a child, but at significant personal or familial cost. At the least, they will incur the cost of losing control of their lives. The Constitution will, today’s majority holds, provide no shield, despite its guarantees of liberty and equality for all. And no one should be confident that this majority is done with its work. The right Roe and Casey recognized does not stand alone. To the contrary, the Court has linked it for decades to other settled freedoms involving bodily integrity, familial relationships, and procreation. Most obviously, the right to terminate a pregnancy arose straight out of the right to purchase and use contraception. . . . In turn, those rights led, more recently, to rights of same-sex intimacy and marriage. . . . They are all part of the same constitutional fabric, protecting autonomous decision making over the most personal of life decisions. . . . The majority has no good reason for the upheaval in law and society it sets off. Roe and Casey have been the law of the land for decades, shaping women’s expectations of their choices when an unplanned pregnancy occurs. Women have relied on the availability of abortion both in structuring their relationships and in planning their lives. The legal framework Roe and Casey developed to balance the competing interests in this sphere has proved workable in courts across the country. No recent developments, in either law or fact, have eroded or cast doubt on those precedents. Nothing, in short, has changed. . . . The Court reverses course today for one reason and one reason only: because the composition of this Court has changed. Stare decisis, this Court has often said, contributes to the actual and perceived integrity of the judicial process by ensuring that decisions are founded in the law rather than in the proclivities of individuals. Today, the proclivities of individuals rule. The Court departs from its obligation to faithfully and impartially apply the law. We dissent. . . . The majority would allow States to ban abortion from conception onward because it does not think forced childbirth at all implicates a woman’s rights to equality and freedom. Today’s Court, that is, does not think there is anything of constitutional significance attached to a woman’s control of her body and the path of her life. Roe and Casey thought that one-sided view misguided. In some sense, that is the difference in a nutshell between our precedents and the majority opinion. The constitutional regime we have lived in for the last 50 years recognized competing interests, and sought a balance between them. The constitutional regime we enter today erases the woman’s interest and recognizes only the State’s (or the Federal Government’s). The majority makes this change based on a single question: Did the reproductive right recognized in Roe and Casey exist in “1868, the year when the Fourteenth Amendment was ratified?” . . . The majority says (and with this much we agree) that the answer to this question is no: In 1868, there was no nationwide right to end a pregnancy, and no thought that the Fourteenth Amendment provided one. Of course, the majority opinion refers as well to some later and earlier history. On the one side of 1868, it goes back as far as the 13th (the 13th!) century. . . . But that turns out to be wheel-spinning. First, it is not clear what relevance such early history should have, even to the majority. . . . If the early history obviously supported abortion rights, the majority would no doubt say that only the views of the Fourteenth Amendment’s ratifiers are germane. . . . Second—and embarrassingly for the majority—early law in fact does provide some support for abortion rights. Common-law authorities did not treat abortion as a crime before “quickening”—the point when the fetus moved in the womb. And early American law followed the common-law rule. So the criminal law of that early time might be taken as roughly consonant with Roe’s and Casey’s different treatment of early and late abortions. Better, then, to move forward in time. On the other side of 1868, the majority occasionally notes that many States barred abortion up to the time of Roe. That is convenient for the majority, but it is window dressing… Had the pre-Roe liberalization of abortion laws occurred more quickly and more widely in the 20th century, the majority would say (once again) that only the ratifiers’views are germane. The majority’s core legal postulate, then, is that we in the 21st century must read the Fourteenth Amendment just as its ratifiers did. And that is indeed what the majority emphasizes over and over again. . . . If the ratifiers did not understand something as central to freedom, then neither can we. Or said more particularly: If those people did not understand reproductive rights as part of the guarantee of liberty conferred in the Fourteenth Amendment, then those rights do not exist. As an initial matter, note a mistake in the just preceding sentence. We referred to the “people” who ratified the Fourteenth Amendment: What rights did those “people” have in their heads at the time? But, of course, “people” did not ratify the Fourteenth Amendment. Men did. So it is perhaps not so surprising that the ratifiers were not perfectly attuned to the importance of reproductive rights for women’s liberty, or for their capacity to participate as equal members of our Nation. Indeed, the ratifiers—both in 1868 and when the original Constitution was approved in 1788—did not understand women as full members of the community embraced by the phrase “We the People.” In 1868, the first wave of American feminists were explicitly told—of course by men—that it was not their time to seek constitutional protections. (Women would not get even the vote for another half-century.). . . . Those responsible for the original Constitution, including the Fourteenth Amendment, did not perceive women as equals, and did not recognize women’s rights. When the majority says that we must read our foundational charter as viewed at the time of ratification (except that we may also check it against the Dark Ages), it consigns women to second-class citizenship. . . . So how is it that, as Casey said, our Constitution, read now, grants rights to women, though it did not in 1868? How is it that our Constitution subjects discrimination against them to heightened scrutiny? How is it that our Constitution, through the Fourteenth Amendment’s liberty clause, guarantees access to contraception (also not legally protected in 1868) so that women can decide for themselves whether and when to bear a child? How is it that until today, that same constitutional clause protected a woman’s right, in the event contraception failed, to end a pregnancy in its earlier stages? The answer is that this Court has rejected the majority’s pinched view of how to read our Constitution. . . . [I]n the words of the great Chief Justice John Marshall, our Constitution is “intended to endure for ages to come,” and must adapt itself to a future “seen dimly,” if at all. . . . That is indeed why our Constitution is written as it is. The Framers (both in 1788 and 1868) understood that the world changes. So they did not define rights by reference to the specific practices existing at the time. Instead, the Framers defined rights in general terms, to permit future evolution in their scope and meaning. And over the course of our history, this Court has taken up the Framers’ invitation. It has kept true to the Framers’ principles by applying them in new ways, responsive to new societal understandings and conditions. . . . Nowhere has that approach been more prevalent than in construing the majestic but open-ended words of the Fourteenth Amendment—the guarantees of “liberty” and “equality” for all. And nowhere has that approach produced prouder moments, for this country and the Court. Consider an example Obergefell used a few years ago. The Court there confronted a claim . . . that the Fourteenth Amendment “must be defined in a most circumscribed manner, with central reference to specific historical practices”—exactly the view today’s majority follows. . . . And the Court specifically rejected that view. In doing so, the Court reflected on what the proposed, historically circumscribed approach would have meant of interracial marriage. The Fourteenth Amendment’s ratifiers did not think it gave black and white people a right to marry each other. To the contrary, contemporaneous practice deemed that act quite as unprotected as abortion. Yet the Court in Loving v. Virginia read the Fourteenth Amendment to embrace the Lovings’ union. If, Obergefell explained, “rights were defined by who exercised them in the past, then received practices could serve as their own continued justification”—even when they conflict with “liberty” and “equality” as later and more broadly understood. The Constitution does not freeze for all time the original view of what those rights guarantee, or how they apply. That does not mean anything goes. The majority wishes people to think there are but two alternatives: (1) accept the original applications of the Fourteenth Amendment and no others, or (2) surrender to judges’ “own ardent views,” ungrounded in law, about the liberty that Americans should enjoy. . . . [A]pplications of liberty and equality can evolve while remaining grounded in constitutional principles, constitutional history, and constitutional precedents. The second Justice Harlan discussed how to strike the right balance when he explained why he would have invalidated a State’s ban on contraceptive use. Judges, he said, are not ‘free to roam where unguided speculation might take them. . . . Yet they also must recognize that the constitutional ‘tradition’ of this country is not captured whole at a single moment. Rather, its meaning gains content from the long sweep of our history and from successive judicial precedents—each looking to the last and each seeking to apply the Constitution’s most fundamental commitments to new conditions. That is why Americans . . . have a right to marry across racial lines. And it is why, to go back to Justice Harlan’s case, Americans have a right to use contraceptives so they can choose for themselves whether to have children. . . . Faced with all these connections between Roe/Casey and judicial decisions recognizing other constitutional rights, the majority tells everyone not to worry. It can (so it says) neatly extract the right to choose from the constitutional edifice without affecting any associated rights. (Think of someone telling you that the Jenga tower simply will not collapse.). . . . According to the majority, no liberty interest is present [in the context of abortion]—because (and only because) the law offered no protection to the woman’s choice in the 19th century. But here is the rub. The law also did not then (and would not for ages) protect a wealth of other things. It did not protect the rights recognized in Lawrence and Obergefell to same-sex intimacy and marriage. It did not protect the right recognized in Loving to marry across racial lines. It did not protect the right recognized in Griswold to contraceptive use. For that matter, it did not protect the right . . . not to be sterilized without consent. So if the majority is right in its legal analysis, all those decisions were wrong, and all those matters properly belong to the States too—whatever the particular state interests involved. And if that is true, it is impossible to understand (as a matter of logic and principle) how the majority can say that its opinion today does not threaten—does not even “undermine”—any number of other constitutional rights. Nor does it even help just to take the majority at its word. Assume the majority is sincere in saying, for whatever reason, that it will go so far and no further. Scout’s honor. Still, the future significance of today’s opinion will be decided in the future. And law often has a way of evolving without regard to original intentions—a way of actually following where logic leads, rather than tolerating hard-to-explain lines. By overruling Roe, Casey, and more than 20 cases reaffirming or applying the constitutional right to abortion, the majority abandons stare decisis, a principle central to the rule of law. [In previous cases overturning precedent,] the Court found, for example, (1) a change in legal doctrine that undermined or made obsolete the earlier decision; (2) a factual change that had the same effect; or (3) an absence of reliance because the earlier decision was less than a decade old. . . . None of those factors apply here: Nothing—and in particular, no significant legal or factual change—supports overturning a half-century of settled law giving women control over their reproductive lives. The Court’s decision makes radical change too easy and too fast, based on nothing more than the new views of new judges. The majority has overruled Roe and Casey for one and only one reason: because it has always despised them, and now it has the votes to discard them. The majority thereby substitutes a rule by judges for the rule of law. This Court will surely face critical question about how its new approach applies. Must a state law allow abortions when necessary to protect a woman’s life and health? And if so, exactly when? How much risk to a woman’s life can a State force her to incur, before the Fourteenth Amendment’s protection of life kicks in? Suppose a patient with pulmonary hypertension has a 30-to-50 percent risk of dying with ongoing pregnancy; is that enough? And short of death, how much illness or injury can the State require her to accept, consistent with the Amendment’s protection of liberty and equality? Further, the Court may face questions about the application of abortion regulations to medical care most people view as quite different from abortion. What about the morning-after pill? IUDs? In vitro fertilization? And how about the use of dilation and evacuation or medication for miscarriage management? . . . Justice Jackson once called a decision he dissented from Korematsu v. United States (1944) a “loaded weapon,” ready to hand for improper uses. . . . We fear that today’s decision, departing from stare decisis for no legitimate reason, is its own loaded weapon. Weakening stare decisis threatens to upend bedrock legal doctrines, far beyond any single decision. Weakening stare decisis creates profound legal instability. And as Casey recognized, weakening stare decisis in a hotly contested case like this one calls into question this Court’s commitment to legal principle. It makes the Court appear not restrained but aggressive, not modest but grasping. In all those ways, today’s decision takes aim, we fear, at the rule of law. . . . Now a new and bare majority of this Court—acting at practically the first moment possible—overrules Roe and Casey. It converts a series of dissenting opinions expressing antipathy toward Roe and Casey into a decision greenlighting even total abortion bans. It eliminates a 50-year-old constitutional right that safeguards women’s freedom and equal station. It breaches a core rule-of-law principle, designed to promote constancy in the law. In doing all of that, it places in jeopardy other rights, from contraception to same-sex intimacy and marriage. And finally, it undermines the Court’s legitimacy. . . . With sorrow—for this Court, but more, for the many millions of American women who have today lost a fundamental constitutional protection—we dissent. Legal case analysis This case, which reshaped the legal landscape of abortion rights, is a landmark in American judicial history. Please read the case details and the court's decision process carefully. Roe v. Wade “We . . . conclude that the right of personal privacy includes the abortion decision, but that this right is not unqualified and must be considered against important state interests in regulation.”——Justice Harry Blackmun (Majority) Summary At a time when Texas law restricted abortions except to save the life of the mother, Jane Roe (a single, pregnant woman) sued Henry Wade, the local district attorney tasked with enforcing the abortion statute. She argued that the Texas law was unconstitutional. The Supreme Court agreed, holding that the right of privacy, inherent in the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, protects a woman’s choice to have an abortion. That right is limited, however, as the pregnancy advances, by the State’s interest in maternal health and in fetal life after viability. Amid national debate over this issue, this was the first time the Court took up this question and affirmed the “right to choose,” as it is often titled. Read the Full Opinion Excerpt: Majority Opinion, Justice Harry Blackmun The Constitution does not explicitly mention any right of privacy. In a line of decisions, however, . . . the Court has recognized that a right of personal privacy, or a guarantee of certain areas or zones of privacy, does exist under the Constitution. In varying contexts, the Court or individual Justices have, indeed, found at least the roots of that right in the First Amendment; in the Fourth and Fifth Amendments; in the penumbras of the Bill of Rights; in the Ninth Amendment; or in the concept of liberty guaranteed by the first section of the Fourteenth Amendment. These decisions make it clear that only personal rights that can be deemed ‘fundamental’ or ‘implicit in the concept of ordered liberty,’ are included in this guarantee of personal privacy. They also make it clear that the right has some extension to activities relating to marriage; procreation; contraception; family relationships; and child rearing and education. This right of privacy, whether it be founded in the Fourteenth Amendment’s concept of personal liberty and restrictions upon state action, as we feel it is, or, as the District Court determined, in the Ninth Amendment’s reservation of rights to the people, is broad enough to encompass a woman’s decision whether or not to terminate her pregnancy. The detriment that the State would impose upon the pregnant woman by denying this choice altogether is apparent. Specific and direct harm medically diagnosable even in early pregnancy may be involved. Maternity, or additional offspring, may force upon the woman a distressful life and future. Psychological harm may be imminent. Mental and physical health may be taxed by child care. There is also the distress, for all concerned, associated with the unwanted child, and there is the problem of bringing a child into a family already unable, psychologically and otherwise, to care for it. In other cases, as in this one, the additional difficulties and continuing stigma of unwed motherhood may be involved. All these are factors the woman and her responsible physician necessarily will consider in consultation. . . . The Court’s decisions recognizing a right of privacy also acknowledge that some state regulation in areas protected by that right is appropriate. [A] State may properly assert important interests in safeguarding health, in maintaining medical standards, and in protecting potential life. At some point in pregnancy, these respective interests become sufficiently compelling to sustain regulation of the factors that govern the abortion decision. The privacy right involved, therefore, cannot be said to be absolute. In fact, it is not clear to us that the claim . . . that one has an unlimited right to do with one’s body as one pleases bears a close relationship to the right of privacy previously articulated in the Court’s decisions. The Court has refused to recognize an unlimited right of this kind in the past. We, therefore, conclude that the right of personal privacy includes the abortion decision, but that this right is not unqualified and must be considered against important state interests in regulation. To summarize and to repeat: 1. A state criminal abortion statute of the current Texas type, that excepts from criminality only a lifesaving procedure on behalf of the mother, without regard to pregnancy stage and without recognition of the other interests involved, is violative of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. (a) For the stage prior to approximately the end of the first trimester, the abortion decision and its effectuation must be left to the medical judgment of the pregnant woman’s attending physician. (b) For the stage subsequent to approximately the end of the first trimester, the State, in promoting its interest in the health of the mother, may, if it chooses, regulate the abortion procedure in ways that are reasonably related to maternal health. (c) For the stage subsequent to viability, the State in promoting its interest in the potentiality of human life may, if it chooses, regulate, and even proscribe, abortion except where it is necessary, in appropriate medical judgment, for the preservation of the life or health of the mother. . . . This holding, we feel, is consistent with the relative weights of the respective interests involved, with the lessons and examples of medical and legal history, with the lenity of the common law, and with the demands of the profound problems of the present day. The decision leaves the State free to place increasing restrictions on abortion as the period of pregnancy lengthens, so long as those restrictions are tailored to the recognized state interests. The decision vindicates the right of the physician to administer medical treatment according to his professional judgment up to the points where important state interests provide compelling justifications for intervention. Up to those points, the abortion decision in all its aspects is inherently, and primarily, a medical decision, and basic responsibility for it must rest with the physician. . . . Excerpt: Dissent, Justice William Rehnquist The Court’s opinion brings to the decision of this troubling question both extensive historical fact and a wealth of legal scholarship. While the opinion thus commands my respect, I find myself nonetheless in fundamental disagreement with those parts of it that invalidate the Texas statute in question, and therefore dissent. . . . I have difficulty in concluding, as the Court does, that the right of “privacy” is involved in this case. Texas, by the statute here challenged, bars the performance of a medical abortion by a licensed physician on a plaintiff such as Roe. A transaction resulting in an operation such as this is not ‘private’ in the ordinary usage of that word. Nor is the ‘privacy’ that the Court finds here even a distant relative of the freedom from searches and seizures protected by the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution, which the Court has referred to as embodying a right to privacy. If the Court means by the term “privacy” no more than that the claim of a person to be free from unwanted state regulation of consensual transactions may be a form of “liberty” protected by the Fourteenth Amendment, there is no doubt that similar claims have been upheld in our earlier decisions on the basis of that liberty. I agree with the statement of MR. JUSTICE STEWART in his concurring opinion that the “liberty,” against deprivation of which without due process the Fourteenth Amendment protects, embraces more than the rights found in the Bill of Rights. But that liberty is not guaranteed absolutely against deprivation, only against deprivation without due process of law. The test traditionally applied in the area of social and economic legislation is whether or not a law such as that challenged has a rational relation to a valid state objective. . . . The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment undoubtedly does place a limit, albeit a broad one, on legislative power to enact laws such as this. If the Texas statute were to prohibit an abortion even where the mother’s life is in jeopardy, I have little doubt that such a statute would lack a rational relation to a valid state objective . . . . But the Court’s sweeping invalidation of any restrictions on abortion during the first trimester is impossible to justify under that standard, and the conscious weighing of competing factors that the Court’s opinion apparently substitutes for the established test is far more appropriate to a legislative judgment than to a judicial one. . . . The fact that a majority of the States reflecting, after all the majority sentiment in those States, have had restrictions on abortions for at least a century is a strong indication, it seems to me, that the asserted right to an abortion is not ‘so rooted in the traditions and conscience of our people as to be ranked as fundamental.’ Even today, when society’s views on abortion are changing, the very existence of the debate is evidence that the ‘right’ to an abortion is not so universally accepted as the appellant would have us believe. To reach its result, the Court necessarily has had to find within the scope of the Fourteenth Amendment a right that was apparently completely unknown to the drafters of the Amendment. As early as 1821, the first state law dealing directly with abortion was enacted by the Connecticut Legislature. . . . By the time of the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment in 1868, there were at least 36 laws enacted by state or territorial legislatures limiting abortion. While many States have amended or updated their laws, 21 of the laws on the books in 1868 remain in effect today. Indeed, the Texas statute struck down today was, as the majority notes, first enacted in 1857, and “has remained substantially unchanged to the present time.” . . . There apparently was no question concerning the validity of this provision or of any of the other state statutes when the Fourteenth Amendment was adopted. The only conclusion possible from this history is that the drafters did not intend to have the Fourteenth Amendment withdraw from the States the power to legislate with respect to this matter. . . . [QUESTION] What is the message from the two cases? A. Roe v. Wade gave women full abortion rights. B. The Fourteenth Amendment is unclear. C. With the conclusion of Roe v. Wade, the right to abortion was largely recognized by society. D. The interest in fetal life trumped the pregnant woman's interest in abortion, so the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. Answer with only one uppercase letter: A, B, C, or D. Explain detailed.
[CONTEXT] Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2024 MAGICDRIVE: STREET VIEW GENERATION WITH DIVERSE 3D GEOMETRY CONTROL ABSTRACT Recent advancements in diffusion models have significantly enhanced the data synthesis with 2D control. Yet, precise 3D control in street view generation, cru- cial for 3D perception tasks, remains elusive. Specifically, utilizing Bird’s-Eye View (BEV) as the primary condition often leads to challenges in geometry control (e.g., height), affecting the representation of object shapes, occlusion patterns, and road surface elevations, all of which are essential to perception data synthesis, es- pecially for 3D object detection tasks. In this paper, we introduce MAGICDRIVE, a novel street view generation framework, offering diverse 3D geometry controls including camera poses, road maps, and 3D bounding boxes, together with textual descriptions, achieved through tailored encoding strategies. Besides, our design incorporates a cross-view attention module, ensuring consistency across multiple camera views. With MAGICDRIVE, we achieve high-fidelity street-view image & video synthesis that captures nuanced 3D geometry and various scene descrip- tions, enhancing tasks like BEV segmentation and 3D object detection.

Fortunately, cutting-edge generative models have illustrated that synthetic data can notably boost performance across various tasks, such as object detection (Chen et al., 2023c) and semantic segmentation (Wu et al., 2023b). Yet, the prevailing methodologies are largely tailored to 2D contexts, primarily relying on 2D bounding boxes (Lin et al., 2014; Han et al., 2021) or segmentation maps (Zhou et al., 2019) as layout conditions (Chen et al., 2023c; Li et al., 2023b). In autonomous driving applications, a thorough grasp of the 3D environment is essential. This demands reliable techniques for tasks like Bird’s-Eye View (BEV) map segmentation (Zhou & Kr¨ ahenb¨ uhl, 2022; Ji et al., 2023) and 3D object detection (Chen et al., 2020; Huang et al., 2021; Liu et al., 2023a; Ge et al., 2023). A genuine 3D geometry representation is crucial for capturing intricate details from 3D annotations, such as road elevations, object heights, and their occlusion pat- ∗Equal contribution. †Corresponding authors.

Consequently, generating multi-camera street-view images according to 3D annotations becomes vital to boost downstream perception tasks. For street-view data synthesis, two pivotal criteria are realism and controllability. Realism requires that the quality of the synthetic data should align with that of real data; and in a given scene, views from varying camera perspectives should remain consistent with one another (Mildenhall et al., 2020). On the other hand, controllability emphasizes the precision in generating street-view images that adhere to provided conditions: the BEV map, 3D object bounding boxes, and camera poses for views. Beyond these core requirements, effective data augmentation should also grant the flexibility to tweak finer scenario attributes, such as prevailing weather conditions or the time of day. Existing solutions like BEVGen (Swerdlow et al., 2023) approach street view generation by encapsulating all semantics within BEV. Conversely, BEVControl (Yang et al., 2023a) starts by projecting 3D coordinates to image views, subsequently using 2D geometric guidance. However, both methods compromise certain geometric dimensions—height is lost in BEVGen and depth in BEVControl. The rise of diffusion models has significantly pushed the boundaries of controllable image gener- ation quality. Specifically, ControlNet (Zhang et al., 2023a) proposes a flexible framework to in- corporate 2D spatial controls based on pre-trained Text-to-Image (T2I) diffusion models (Rombach et al., 2022). However, 3D conditions are distinct from pixel-level conditions or text. The challenge of seamlessly integrating them with multi-camera view consistency in street view synthesis remains. In this paper, we introduce MAGICDRIVE, a novel framework dedicated to street-view synthesis with diverse 3D geometry controls1. For realism, we harness the power of pre-trained stable dif- fusion (Rombach et al., 2022), further fine-tuning it for street view generation. One distinctive component of our framework is the cross-view attention module. This simple yet effective com- ponent provides multi-view consistency through interactions between adjacent views. In contrast to previous methods, MAGICDRIVE proposes a separate design for objects and road map encoding to improve controllability with 3D data. More specifically, given the sequence-like, variable-length nature of 3D bounding boxes, we employ cross-attention akin to text embeddings for their encod- ing. Besides, we propose that an addictive encoder branch like ControlNet (Zhang et al., 2023a) can encode maps in BEV and is capable of view transformation. Therefore, our design achieves geometric controls without resorting to any explicit geometric transformations or imposing geomet- ric constraints on multi-camera consistency. Finally, MAGICDRIVE factors in textual descriptions, offering attribute control such as weather conditions and time of day. Our MAGICDRIVE framework, despite its simplicity, excels in generating strikingly realistic images & videos that align with road maps, 3D bounding boxes, and varied camera perspectives. Besides, the images produced can enhance the training for both 3D object detection and BEV segmentation tasks. Furthermore, MAGICDRIVE offers comprehensive geometric controls at the scene, back- ground, and foreground levels. This flexibility makes it possible to craft previously unseen street views suitable for simulation purposes. We summarize the main contributions of this work as: • The introduction of MAGICDRIVE, an innovative framework that generates multi-perspective camera views & videos conditioned on BEV and 3D data tailored for autonomous driving. • The development of simple yet potent strategies to manage 3D geometric data, effectively ad- dressing the challenges of multi-camera view consistency in street view generation. • Through rigorous experiments, we demonstrate that MAGICDRIVE outperforms prior street view generation techniques, notably for the multi-dimensional controllability. Additionally, our results reveal that synthetic data delivers considerable improvements in 3D perception tasks. 1In this paper, our 3D geometry controls contain control from road maps, 3D object boxes, and camera poses. We do not consider others like the exact shape of objects or background contents. 2 Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2024 2 RELATED WORK Diffusion Models for Conditional Generation. Diffusion models (Ho et al., 2020; Song et al., 2020; Zheng et al., 2023) generate images by learning a progressive denoising process from the Gaussian noise distribution to the image distribution. These models have proven exceptional across diverse tasks, such as text-to-image synthesis (Rombach et al., 2022; Nichol et al., 2022; Yang et al., 2023b), inpainting (Wang et al., 2023a), and instructional image editing (Zhang et al., 2023b; Brooks et al., 2023), due to their adaptability and competence in managing various form of controls (Zhang et al., 2023a; Li et al., 2023b) and multiple conditions (Liu et al., 2022a; Gao et al., 2023). Besides, data synthesized from geometric annotations can aid downstream tasks such as 2D object detec- tion (Chen et al., 2023c; Wu et al., 2023b). Thus, this paper explores the potential of T2I diffusion models in generating street-view images and benefiting downstream 3D perception models. Street View Generation. Numerous street view generation models condition on 2D layouts, such as 2D bounding boxes (Li et al., 2023b) and semantic segmentation (Wang et al., 2022). These methods leverage 2D layout information corresponding directly to image scale, whereas the 3D information does not possess this property, thereby rendering such methods unsuitable for leveraging 3D infor- mation for generation. For street view synthesis with 3D geometry, BEVGen (Swerdlow et al., 2023) is the first to explore. It utilizes a BEV map as a condition for both roads and vehicles. However, the omission of height information limits its application in 3D object detection. BEVControl (Yang et al., 2023a) amends the loss of object’s height by the height-lifting process. Similarly, Wang et al. (2023b) also projects 3D boxes to camera views to guide generation. However, the projection from 3D to 2D results in the loss of essential 3D geometric information, like depth and occlusion. In this paper, we propose to encode bounding boxes and road maps separately for more nuanced control and integrate scene descriptions, offering enhanced control over the generation of street views. Multi-camera Image Generation of a 3D scene fundamentally requires viewpoint consistency. Several studies have addressed this issue within the context of indoor scenes. For instance, MVDif- fusion (Tang et al., 2023) employs panoramic images and a cross-view attention module to maintain global consistency, while Tseng et al. (2023) leverage epipolar geometry as a constraining prior. These approaches, however, primarily rely on the continuity of image views, a condition not always met in street views due to limited camera overlap and different camera configurations (e.g., expo- sure, intrinsic). Our MAGICDRIVE introduces extra cross-view attention modules to UNet, which significantly enhances consistency across multi-camera views. 3 PRELIMINARY Problem Formulation. In this paper, we consider the coordinate of the LiDAR system as the ego car’s coordinate, and parameterize all geometric information according to it. Let S = {M, B, L} be the description of a driving scene around the ego vehicle, where M ∈{0, 1}w×h×c is the binary map representing a w × h meter road area in BEV with c semantic classes, B = {(ci, bi)}N i=1 represents the 3D bounding box position (bi = {(xj, yj, zj)}8 j=1 ∈R8×3) and class (ci ∈C) for each object in the scene, and L is the text describing additional information about the scene (e.g., weather and time of day). Given a camera pose P = [K, R, T] (i.e., intrinsics, rotation, and translation), the goal of street-view image generation is to learn a generator G(·) which synthesizes realistic images I ∈RH×W ×3 corresponding to the scene S and camera pose P as, I = G(S, P, z), where z ∼N(0, 1) is a random noise from Gaussian distribution. Conditional Diffusion Models. Diffusion models (Ho et al., 2020; Song et al., 2020) generate data (x0) by iteratively denoising a random Gaussian noise (xT ) for T steps. Typically, to learn the denoising process, the network is trained to predict the noise by minimizing the mean-square error: ℓsimple = Ex0,c,ϵ,t  ||ϵ −ϵθ(√¯ αtx0 + √ 1 −¯ αtϵ, t, c)||2 , (1) where ϵθ is the network to train, with parameters θ, c is optional conditions, which is used for the conditional generation, t ∈[0, T] is the time-step, ϵ ∈N(0, I) is the additive Gaussian noise, and ¯ αt is a scalar parameter. Latent diffusion models (LDM) (Rombach et al., 2022) is a special kind of diffusion model, where they utilize a pre-trained Vector Quantized Variational AutoEncoder (VQ- VAE) (Esser et al., 2021) and perform diffusion process in the latent space. Given the VQ-VAE encoder as z = E(x), one can rewrite ϵθ(·) in Equation 1 as ϵθ(√¯ αtE(x0) + √1 −¯ αtϵ, t, c) for LDM. Besides, LDM considers text describing the image as condition c. 3 Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2024 Road Map Object Box Camera Pose Prompt: “A driving scene <description>” <CAM> <TXT> <BOX 1> ... <BOX n> Seq Embedding: Q KV UNet Q KV Q KV “A driving scene ...

MAGICDRIVE generates highly realistic images, exploiting geometric information from 3D annotations by independently encoding road maps, object boxes, and camera parameters for precise, geometry-guided synthesis. Additionally, MAGICDRIVE accommodates guidance from descriptive conditions (e.g., weather). 4 STREET VIEW GENERATION WITH 3D INFORMATION The overview of MAGICDRIVE is depicted in Figure 3. Operating on the LDM pipeline, MAG- ICDRIVE generates street-view images conditioned on both scene annotations (S) and the camera pose (P) for each view. Given the 3D geometric information in scene annotations, projecting all to a BEV map, akin to BEVGen (Swerdlow et al., 2023) or BEVControl (Yang et al., 2023a), doesn’t ensure precise guidance for street view generation, as exemplified in Figure 2. Consequently, MAG- ICDRIVE categorizes conditions into three levels: scene (text and camera pose), foreground (3D bounding boxes), and background (road map); and integrates them separately via cross-attention and an additive encoder branch, detailed in Section 4.1. Additionally, maintaining consistency across different cameras is crucial for synthesizing street views. Thus, we introduce a simple yet effective cross-view attention module in Section 4.2. Lastly, we elucidate our training strategies in Section 4.3, emphasizing Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) in integrating various conditions. 4.1 GEOMETRIC CONDITIONS ENCODING As illustrated in Figure 3, two strategies are employed for information injection into the UNet of diffusion models: cross-attention and additive encoder branch. Given that the attention mecha- nism (Vaswani et al., 2017) is tailored for sequential data, cross-attention is apt for managing vari- able length inputs like text tokens and bounding boxes. Conversely, for grid-like data, such as road maps, the additive encoder branch is effective in information injection (Zhang et al., 2023a). There- fore, MAGICDRIVE employs distinct encoding modules for various conditions. Scene-level Encoding includes camera pose P = {K ∈R3×3, R ∈R3×3, T ∈R3×1}, and text sequence L. For text, we construct the prompt with a template as “A driving scene image at {location}. {description} ”, and leverage a pre-trained CLIP text encoder (Etext) as LDM (Rombach et al., 2022), as shown by Equation 2, where L is the token length of L. As for camera pose, we first concat each parameter by their column, resulting in ¯ P = [K, R, T]T ∈R7×3. Since ¯ P contains values from sin/cos functions and also 3D offsets, to have the model effectively interpret these high-frequency variations, we apply Fourier embedding (Mildenhall et al., 2020) to each 3-dim vector before leveraging a Multi-Layer Perception (MLP, Ecam) to embed the camera pose parameters, as in Equation 3. To maintain consistency, we set the dimension of hc the same as that of ht i. Through the CLIP text encoder, each text embedding ht i already contains positional information (Radford et al., 2021). Therefore, we prepend the camera pose embedding hc to text embeddings, resulting in scene-level embedding hs = [hc, ht]. ht = [ht 1 . . . ht L] = Etext(L), (2) hc = Ecam(Fourier(¯ P)) = Ecam(Fourier([K, R, T]T )). (3) 3D Bounding Box Encoding. Since each driving scene has a variable length of bounding boxes, we inject them through the cross-attention mechanism similar to scene-level information. Specifically, we encode each box into a hidden vector hb, which has the same dimensions as that of ht. Each 3D bounding box (ci, bi) contains two types of information: class label ci and box position bi.

Cross-view attention guarantees consistency across multiple views. class labels, we utilize the method similar to Li et al. (2023b), where the pooled embeddings of class names (Lci) are considered as label embeddings. For box positions bi ∈R8×3, represented by the coordinates of its 8 corner points, we utilize Fourier embedding to each point and pass through an MLP for encoding, as in Equation 4. Then, we use an MLP to compress both class and position embedding into one hidden vector, as in Equation 5. The final hidden states for all bounding boxes of each scene are represented as hb = [hb 1 . . . hb N], where N is the number of boxes. eb c(i) = AvgPool(Etext(Lci)), eb p(i) = MLPp(Fourier(bi)), (4) hb i = Ebox(ci, bi) = MLPb(eb c(i), eb p(i)). (5) Ideally, the model learns the geometric relationship between bounding boxes and camera pose through training. However, the distribution of the number of visible boxes to different views is long-tailed. Thus, we bootstrap learning by filtering visible objects to each view (vi), i.e., fviz in Equation 6. Besides, we also add invisible boxes for augmentation (more details in Section 4.3). hb vi = {hb i ∈hb|fviz(bi, Rvi, Tvi) > 0}. (6) Road Map Encoding. The road map has a 2D-grid format. While Zhang et al. (2023a) shows the addictive encoder can incorporate this kind of data for 2D guidance, the inherent perspective differences between the road map’s BEV and the camera’s First-Person View (FPV) create discrep- ancies. BEVControl (Yang et al., 2023a) employs a back-projection to transform from BEV to FPV but complicates the situation with an ill-posed problem. In MAGICDRIVE, we propose that explicit view transformation is unnecessary, as sufficient 3D cues (e.g., height from object boxes and cam- era pose) allow the addictive encoder to accomplish view transformation. Specifically, we integrate scene-level and 3D bounding box embeddings into the map encoder (see Figure 3). Scene-level em- beddings provide camera poses, and box embeddings offer road elevation cues. Additionally, incor- porating text descriptions facilitates the generation of roads under varying conditions (e.g., weather and time of day). Thus, the map encoder can synergize with other conditions for generation. 4.2 CROSS-VIEW ATTENTION MODULE In multi-camera view generation, it is crucial that image synthesis remains consistent across different perspectives. To maintain consistency, we introduce a cross-view attention module (Figure 4). Given the sparse arrangement of cameras in driving contexts, each cross-view attention allows the target view to access information from its immediate left and right views, as in Equation 7; here, t, l, and r are the target, left, and right view respectively. Then, the target view aggregates such information with skip connection, as in Equation 8, where hv indicates the hidden state of the target view. Attentioni cv(Qt, Ki, Vi) = softmax( QtKT i √ d ) · Vi, i ∈{l, r}, (7) hv out = hv in + Attentionl cv + Attentionr cv . (8) We inject cross-view attention after the cross-attention module in the UNet and apply zero- initialization (Zhang et al., 2023a) to bootstrap the optimization. The efficacy of the cross-view attention module is demonstrated in Figure 4 right, Figure 5, and Figure 6. The multilayered struc- ture of UNet enables aggregating information from long-range views after several stacked blocks. Therefore, using cross-view attention on adjacent views is enough for multi-view consistency, fur- ther evidenced by the ablation study in Appendix C. 5 Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2024 4.3 MODEL TRAINING Classifier-free Guidance reinforces the impact of conditional guidance (Ho & Salimans, 2021; Rombach et al., 2022). For effective CFG, models need to discard conditions during training occa- sionally. Given the unique nature of each condition, applying a drop strategy is complex for multiple conditions. Therefore, our MAGICDRIVE simplifies this for four conditions by concurrently drop- ping scene-level conditions (camera pose and text embeddings) at a rate of γs. For boxes and maps, which have semantic representations for null (i.e., padding token in boxes and 0 in maps) in their encoding, we maintain them throughout training. At inference, we utilize null for all conditions, enabling meaningful amplification to guide generation. Training Objective and Augmentation. With all the conditions injected as inputs, we adapt the training objective described in Section 3 to the multi-condition scenario, as in Equation 9. ℓ= Ex0,ϵ,t,{S,P }  ||ϵ −ϵθ(√¯ αtE(x0) + √ 1 −¯ αtϵ, t, {S, P})||  . (9) Besides, we emphasize two essential strategies when training our MAGICDRIVE. First, to counteract our filtering of visible boxes, we randomly add 10% invisible boxes as an augmentation, enhancing the model’s geometric transformation capabilities. Second, to leverage cross-view attention, which facilitates information sharing across multiple views, we apply unique noises to different views in each training step, preventing trivial solutions to Equation 9 (e.g., outputting the shared component across different views). Identical random noise is reserved exclusively for inference. 5 EXPERIMENTS 5.1 EXPERIMENTAL SETUPS Dataset and Baselines. We employ the nuScenes dataset (Caesar et al., 2020), a prevalent dataset in BEV segmentation and detection for driving, as the testing ground for MAGICDRIVE. We adhere to the official configuration, utilizing 700 street-view scenes for training and 150 for validation. Our baselines are BEVGen (Swerdlow et al., 2023) and BEVControl (Yang et al., 2023a), both recent propositions for street view generation. Our method considers 10 object classes and 8 road classes, surpassing the baseline models in diversity. Appendix B holds additional details. Evaluation Metrics. We evaluate both realism and controllability for street view generation. Real- ism is mainly measured using Fr´ echet Inception Distance (FID), reflecting image synthesis quality. For controllability, MAGICDRIVE is evaluated through two perception tasks: BEV segmentation and 3D object detection, with CVT (Zhou & Kr¨ ahenb¨ uhl, 2022) and BEVFusion (Liu et al., 2023a) as perception models, respectively. Both of them are renowned for their performance in each task. Firstly, we generate images aligned with the validation set annotations and use perception models pre-trained with real data to assess image quality and control accuracy. Then, data is generated based on the training set to examine the support for training perception models as data augmentation. Model Setup. Our MAGICDRIVE utilizes pre-trained weights from Stable Diffusion v1.5, train- ing only newly added parameters. Per Zhang et al. (2023a), a trainable UNet encoder is created for Emap. New parameters, except for the zero-init module and the class token, are randomly initialized. We adopt two resolutions to reconcile discrepancies in perception tasks and baselines: 224×400 (0.25× down-sample) following BEVGen and for CVT model support, and a higher 272×736 (0.5× down-sample) for BEVFusion support. Unless stated otherwise, images are sampled using the UniPC (Zhao et al., 2023) scheduler for 20 steps with CFG at 2.0. 5.2 MAIN RESULTS Realism and Controllability Validation. We assess MAGICDRIVE’s capability to create realistic street-view images with the annotations from the nuScenes validation set. As shown by Table 1, MAGICDRIVE outperforms others in image quality, yielding notably lower FID scores. Regarding controllability, assessed via BEV segmentation tasks, MAGICDRIVE equals or exceeds baseline re- sults at 224×400 resolution due to the distinct encoding design that enhances vehicle generation precision. At 272×736 resolution, our encoding strategy advancements enhance vehicle mIoU per- formance. Cropping large areas negatively impacts road mIoU on CVT. However, our bounding box encoding efficacy is backed by BEVFusion’s results in 3D object detection. 6 Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2024 Table 1: Comparison of generation fidelity with driving-view generation methods. Conditions for data synthesis are from nuScenes validation set. For each task, we test the corresponding models trained on the nuScenes training set.

We highlight some areas with rectangles to ease comparison. Compared with BEVControl, genera- tions from MAGICDRIVE appear more consistent in both background and foreground. Training Support for BEV Segmentation and 3D Object Detection. MAGICDRIVE can produce augmented data with accurate annotation controls, enhancing the training for perception tasks. For BEV segmentation, we augment an equal number of images as in the original dataset, ensuring con- sistent training iterations and batch sizes for fair comparisons to the baseline. As shown in Table 3, MAGICDRIVE significantly enhances CVT in both settings, outperforming BEVGen, which only marginally improves vehicle segmentation. For 3D object detection, we train BEVFusion models with MAGICDRIVE ’s synthetic data as augmentation. To optimize data augmentation, we randomly exclude 50% of bounding boxes in each generated scene. Table 2 shows the advantageous impact of MAGICDRIVE ’s data in both CAM-only (C) and CAM+LiDAR (C+L) settings. It’s crucial to note that in CAM+LiDAR settings, BEVFusion utilizes both modalities for object detection, requiring more precise image generation due to LiDAR data incorporation. Nevertheless, MAGICDRIVE’s synthetic data integrates seamlessly with LiDAR inputs, highlighting the data’s high fidelity. 5.3 QUALITATIVE EVALUATION Comparison with Baselines. We assessed MAGICDRIVE against two baselines, BEVGen and BEVControl, synthesizing multi-camera views for the same validation scenes (the comparison with BEVGen is in the Appendix D). Figure 5 illustrates that MAGICDRIVE generates images markedly superior in quality to BEVControl, particularly excelling in accurate object positioning and main- taining consistency in street views for backgrounds and objects. Such performance primarily stems from MAGICDRIVE ’s bounding box encoder and its cross-view attention module. Multi-level Controls. The design of MAGICDRIVE introduces multi-level controls to street-view generation through separation encoding. This section demonstrates the capabilities of MAGIC- DRIVE by exploring three control signal levels: scene level (time of day and weather), background level (BEV map alterations and conditional views), and foreground level (object orientation and dele- tion). As illustrated in Figure 1, Figure 6, and Appendix E, MAGICDRIVE adeptly accommodates alterations at each level, maintaining multi-camera consistency and high realism in generation. 7 Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2024 Table 2: Comparison about support for 3D object detection model (i.e., BEVFusion).

We show background-level and foreground-level control separately with different conditions. All scenes are based on the nuScenes validation set. More results are in Appendix E. 5.4 EXTENSION TO VIDEO GENERATION We demonstrate the extensibility of MAGICDRIVE to video generation by fine-tuning it on nuScenes videos. This involves modifying self-attention to ST-Attn (Wu et al., 2023a), adding a temporal attention module to each transformer block (Figure 7 left), and tuning the model on 7-frame clips with only the first and the last frames having bounding boxes. We sample initial noise independently for each frame using the UniPC (Zhao et al., 2023) sampler for 20 steps and illustrate an example in Figure 7 right. Furthermore, by utilizing the interpolated annotations from ASAP (Wang et al., 2023c) like Drive- Dreamer (Wang et al., 2023b), MagicDrive can be extended to 16-frame video generation at 12Hz trained on Nvidia V100 GPUs. More results (e.g., video visualization) can be found on our website. 6 ABLATION STUDY Bounding Box Encoding. MAGICDRIVE utilizes separate encoders for bounding boxes and road maps. To demonstrate the efficacy, we train a ControlNet (Zhang et al., 2023a) that takes the BEV map with both road and object semantics as a condition (like BEVGen), denoted as “w/o Ebox” in Table 4. Objects in BEV maps are relatively small, which require separate Ebox for accurate vehicle annotations, as shown by the vehicle mIoU performance gap. Applying visible object filter fviz significantly improves both road and vehicle mIoU by reducing the optimization burden. A MAG- ICDRIVE variant incorporating Ebox with BEV of road and object semantics didn’t enhance perfor- mance, emphasizing the importance of integrating diverse information through different strategies. Effect of Classifier-free Guidance. We focus on the two most crucial conditions, i.e. object boxes and road maps, and analyze how CFG affects the performance of generation. We change CFG from 1.5 to 4.0 and plot the change of validation results from CVT in Figure 8. Firstly, by increasing 8 Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2024 ST-Attn cross-view attn cross-attn <CAM> <TXT> <BOXes> Left Neighbor Right Neighbor Tansformer Block Trainable Frozen KV Q temp attn Key + Prev. frames Keyframe Keyframe Figure 7: Extend MAGICDRIVE to video generation.

Evaluation results are from CVT on the synthetic nuScenes validation set, without M = {0} in CFG scale = 2. MAGICDRIVE has better controllability and keeps image quality.

CFG scale, FID degrades due to notable changes in contrast and sharpness, as seen in previous stud- ies (Chen et al., 2023c). Secondly, retaining the same map for both conditional and unconditional inference eliminates CFG’s effect on the map condition. As shown by blue lines of Figure 8, increas- ing CFG scale results in the highest vehicle mIoU at CFG=2.5, but the road mIoU keeps decreasing. Thirdly, with M = {0} for unconditional inference in CFG, road mIoU significantly increases. However, it slightly degrades the guidance on vehicle generation. As mentioned in Section 4.3, CFG complexity increases with more conditions. Despite simplifying training, various CFG choices exist during inference. We leave the in-depth investigation for this case as future work. 7 CONCLUSION This paper presents MAGICDRIVE, a novel framework to encode multiple geometric controls for high-quality multi-camera street view generation. With the separation encoding design, MAGIC- DRIVE fully utilizes geometric information from 3D annotations and realizes accurate semantic control for street views. Besides, the proposed cross-view attention module is simple yet effective in guaranteeing consistency across multi-camera views. As evidenced by experiments, the generations from MAGICDRIVE show high realism and fidelity to 3D annotations. Multiple controls equipped MAGICDRIVE with improved generalizability for the generation of novel street views. Meanwhile, MAGICDRIVE can be used for data augmentation, facilitating the training for perception models on both BEV segmentation and 3D object detection tasks. GroundTruth + night (a) not dark enough GroundTruth + snow (b) unseen weather Figure 9: Failure cases of MAGICDRIVE. Limitation and Future Work. We show failure cases from MAGICDRIVE in Figure 9. Although MAGICDRIVE can generate night views, they are not as dark as real images (as in Figure 9a). This may be due to that diffusion models are hard to generate too dark images (Guttenberg, 2023). Fig- ure 9b shows that MAGICDRIVE cannot generate unseen weathers for nuScenes. Future work may focus on how to improve the cross-domain generalization ability of street view generation. 9 Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2024 Acknowledgement.

The dashed lines in (b-c) represent the x-axis of the camera’s coordinates. Boxes are retained only if they have at least a point in the positive half of the z-axis in each camera’s coordinate. In Equation 6, we employ fviz for object filtering to facilitate bootstrap learning. We show more details of fviz here. Refer to Figure 10 for illustration. For the sake of simplicity, each camera’s Field Of View (FOV) is not considered. Objects are defined as visible if any corner of their bounding boxes is located in front of the camera (i.e., zvi > 0) within each camera’s coordinate system. The application of fviz significantly lightens the workload of the bounding box encoder, evidence for which can be found in Section 6. B MORE EXPERIMENTAL DETAILS Semantic Classes for Generation. To support most perception models on nuScenes, we try to include semantics commonly used in most settings (Huang et al., 2021; Zhou & Kr¨ ahenb¨ uhl, 2022; Liu et al., 2023a; Ge et al., 2023). Specifically, for objects, ten categories include car, bus, truck, trailer, motorcycle, bicycle, construction vehicle, pedestrian, barrier, and traffic cone. For the road map, eight categories include drivable area, pedestrian crossing, walkway, stop line, car parking area, road divider, lane divider, and roadblock. Optimization. We train all newly added parameters using AdamW (Loshchilov & Hutter, 2019) optimizer and a constant learning rate at 8e−5 and batch size 24 (total 144 images for 6 views) with a linear warm-up of 3000 iterations, and set γs = 0.2. C ABLATION ON NUMBER OF ATTENDING VIEWS Table 5: Ablation on number of attending views. Evaluation results are from CVT on the synthetic nuScenes validation set, without M = {0} in CFG scale = 2. Attending Num. FID ↓ Road mIoU ↑ Vehicle mIoU ↑ 1 13.06 58.63 26.41 2 (ours) 14.46 59.31 27.13 5 (all) 14.76 58.35 25.41 In Table 5, we demonstrate the impact of varying the number of attended views on evaluation re- sults. Attending to a single view yields superior FID results; the reduced influx of information from neighboring views simplifies optimization for that view. However, this approach compromises mIoU, also reflecting less consistent generation, as depicted in Figure 11. Conversely, incorporat- ing all views deteriorates performance across all metrics, potentially due to excessive information causing interference in cross-attention. Since each view has an intersection with both left and right views, attending to one view cannot guarantee consistency, especially for foreground objects, while attending to more views requires more computation. Thus, we opt for 2 attended views in our main paper, striking a balance between consistency and computational efficiency. 13 Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2024 Attend to 2 views Attend to 1 view Figure 11: Comparison between different numbers of attending views. Only attending to one view results in worse multi-camera consistency. D QUALITATIVE COMPARISON WITH BEVGEN Figure 12 illustrates that MAGICDRIVE generates images with higher quality compared to BEV- Gen (Swerdlow et al., 2023), particularly excelling in objects. Such enhancement can be attributed to MAGICDRIVE’s utilization of the diffusion model and the adoption of a customized condition injection strategy. BEVGen Ground Truth Fail to gen. Low quality Wrong place Figure 12: Qualitative comparison with BEVGen on driving scene from nuScenes validation set. We highlight some areas with rectangles to ease comparison. Compared with BEVGen, image quality of objects from MAGICDRIVE is much better. E MORE RESULTS WITH CONTROL FROM DIFFERENT CONDITIONS Figure 13 shows scene level control (time of day) and background level control (BEV map alter- ations). MAGICDRIVE can effectively reflect these changes in control conditions through the gener- ated camera views. Scene level: prompt + “night, difficult lighting” Background level: flip map and boxes from left to right (in world coordinate) Generation from Figure 13: Showcase for scene-level control with MAGICDRIVE. The scene is from the nuScenes validation set. 14 Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2024 F MORE EXPERIMENTS WITH 3D OBJECT DETECTION Table 6: Comparison about support for 3D object detection model (i.e., BEVFusion). MAGICDRIVE generates 272×736 images for augmentation. Results are from tests on the nuScenes validation set. Epoch Data CAM-Only CAM+LiDAR mAP ↑ NDS ↑ mAP ↑ NDS ↑ 0.5× w/o synthetic data 30.21 32.76 too few epochs too few epochs w/ MAGICDRIVE 33.29 (+3.08) 36.69 (+3.93) 1× w/o synthetic data 32.88 37.81 65.40 69.59 w/ MAGICDRIVE 35.40 (+2.52) 39.76 (+1.95) 67.86 (+2.46) 70.72 (+1.13) 2× w/o synthetic data 35.49 40.66 68.33 71.31 w/ MAGICDRIVE 35.74 (+0.25) 41.40 (+0.74) 68.58 (+0.25) 71.34 (+0.03) In Table 6, we show additional experimental results on training 3D object detection models using synthetic data produced by MAGICDRIVE. Given that BEVFusion utilizes a lightweight backbone (i.e., Swin-T (Liu et al., 2021)), model performance appears to plateau with training through 1- 2× epochs (2×: 20 for CAM-Only and 6 for CAM+LiDAR). Reducing epochs can mitigate this saturation, allowing more varied data to enhance the model’s perceptual capacity in both settings. This improvement is evident even when epochs for 3D object detection are further reduced to 0.5×. Our MAGICDRIVE accurately augments street-view images with the annotations. Future works may focus on annotation sampling and construction strategies for synthetic data augmentation. G MORE DISCUSSION More future work. Note that MAGICDRIVE-generated street views can currently only perform as augmented samples to train with real data, and it is exciting to train detectors solely with generated data, which will be explored in the future. More flexible usage of the generated street views beyond data augmentation, especially incorporation with generative pre-training (Chen et al., 2023a; Zhili et al., 2023), contrastive learning (Chen et al., 2021; Liu et al., 2022b) and the large language models (LLMs) (Chen et al., 2023b; Gou et al., 2023), is an appealing future research direction. It is also interesting to utilize the geometric controls in different circumstances beyond 3D scenarios (e.g., multi-object tracking (Li et al., 2023a) and concept removal (Liu et al., 2023b)).

From the results, we observe that, firstly, the improvements for large objects are sig- nificant, for example, buses, trailers, and construction vehicles. Secondly, objects with less diverse appearances, such as traffic cones and barriers, show more improvement, especially compared to trucks. Thirdly, we note that the improvement is marginal for cars, while significant for pedestri- ans, motorcycles, and bicycles. This may be because the baseline already performs well for cars. For pedestrians, motorcycles, and bicycles, even though distant objects from the ego car are gen- erated less faithfully, MAGICDRIVE can synthesize high-quality objects near the ego car, as shown in Figure 17-18. Therefore, more accurate detection of objects near the ego car contributes to im- provements for these classes. Overall, mAP improvement comes with promotion in all classes’ AP, indicating MAGICDRIVE can indeed help the training of perception models. 15 Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2024 I MORE RESULTS FOR BEV SEGMENTATION BEVFusion is also capable of BEV segmentation and considers most of the classes we used in the BEV map condition. Due to the lack of baselines, we present the results in Table 8 to facilitate com- parison for future works. As can be seen, the 272×736 resolution does not outperform the 224×400 resolution. This is consistent with the results from CVT in Table 1 on the Road segment. Such results confirm that better map controls rely on maintaining the original aspect ratio for generation training (i.e., avoiding cropping on each side).

However, the generalization ability is somewhat limited due to nuScenes fixing camera poses for different scenes. Nevertheless, we attempt to exchange the intrinsic and extrinsic parameters between the three front cameras and three back cameras. The comparison is shown in Figure 14. Since the positions of the nuScenes cameras are not symmetrical from front to back, and the back camera has a 120◦FOV compared to the 70◦FOV of the other cam- eras, clear differences between front and back views can be observed for the same 3D coordinates. 120° 120° 70° 70° Figure 14: To show the generalization ability of learned camera encoding, we exchange the camera parameters between 3 front cameras and 3 back cameras. The 3D position is the same for two generations. We highlight some areas (with box boxes) 16 Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2024 K MORE GENERATION RESULTS We show some corner-case (Li et al., 2022) generations in Figure 15, and more generations in Figure 16-Figure 18.

A. MagicDrive encode the class labels of bounding box by the method similar to Li et al, where the pooled embeddings of the class names are considered as the label embeddings. And then uses an MLP to compress both the class and text embeddings into a single hidden vector for each bounding box. B. MagicDrive uses Fourier embedding for 4 corner point and passes them through an MLP for encoding in training step. MagicDrive then uses an MLP to compress both the class label and position embeddings into a single hidden vector for each bounding box. C. MagicDrive using the text encoder to encode the class label of bounding box, and then uses an MLP to compress both the class and text embeddings into a single hidden vector for each bounding box. D. MagicDrive encode the class labels and the corner points separately, and then uses an MLP to compress them into a vector. Answer with only one uppercase letter: A, B, C, or D. Explain detailed.
